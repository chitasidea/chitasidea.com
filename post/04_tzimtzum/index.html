Moses did just this at Sinai, where he was commanded to &ldquo;prepare them today and tomorrow&rdquo; (Shemot 18:10). When the might of Hashem grew too strong for them and they requested &ldquo;You speak with us, and we will hear, but let G-d not speak with us lest we die&rdquo; (Shemot 19:16), Moses stepped in. After the Sin of the Golden Calf, Moses stood before his people to receive Hashem&rsquo;s severity on their part. Moses was the first to exemplify these qualities of Jewish leadership and throughout every generation leaders have followed to extend and solidify his heritage.</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/05_clarity/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Clarity</span></a>
