This means that every one is judged by Hashem on his own level. A different level of service is expected of &ldquo;one who draws ever nearer to G-d, His Torah, and His service&rdquo; than of the kal shebekalim. Each has a separate role to play in the cosmic design, and neither is recognized before the other. In truth, Hashem gives each person the exact combination of attributes needed to accomplish his purpose in this world. This realization will eliminate all pride and jealousy from the world, crushing the spirit of the sitra achara in the animal soul and enabling the light of the Divine soul to shine forth.</p><p>&ldquo;He gave them the lands of nations, they inherited the toil of peoples, so that they might keep His statutes and observe His laws. Praise the Lord!&rdquo; (Tehillim 105:44-45)</p><p>All that Hashem has given us–all our spiritual wealth, our knowledge, intelligence, and attachment, and all our material wealth–He has only given us so that we may use it to &ldquo;keep His statues and observe His laws,&rdquo; to &ldquo;make a dwelling place for G–d in this world&rdquo; (Tanya, Chapter 33). And besides that, &ldquo;Siz Doch Altz hevel havolim, Ein od milvado&rdquo; (It&rsquo;s all vanity of vanities.
