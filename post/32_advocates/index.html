They encompass us and act as our strongest advocates.</p><p>&ldquo;Yet He is compassionate, pardons iniquity, and does not destroy; time and again He turns away His anger, and does not arouse all His wrath. He remembered that they were but flesh, a spirit that leaves and does not return.&rdquo; (Tehillim 78:38-39)</p><p>Because of our mitzvos, Hashem summons his attribute of infinite mercy, pardoning all kinds of iniquity. He remembers that we are mere human beings, but the mitzvos we did and do are perfect and eternal. When we meditate on the transcendent power of our mitzvos, we realize that they are not just routine tasks to be completed with minimal effort, but the very basis of our lives and continued existence on this earth and in the World to Come.</p></section><nav class=post-nav>
