Instead, he will turn towards the wisdom that every action has spiritual consequences, individual and general, and thus his &ldquo;fear&rdquo; will be the beginning of a path towards &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; and close attachment to G‑d in all matters and deeds.</p><p>&ldquo;And Aaron shall bring his sin offering bull, and initiate atonement for himself and for his household.&rdquo; (Vayikra 16:6)</p><p>Similarly, Aaron could only begin the lofty Yom Kippur service <em>after</em> he initiated atonement for himself and for his household. Only when he was free from the weight of his prior misdeeds, regaining a consciousness of Hashem&rsquo;s presence in all matters and committing to follow Hashem from now on, was he able to entreat the Shechinah to effect atonement for the Jewish people.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/186_fourkingdoms/><span>←</span><span>Four Kingdoms</span></a>
