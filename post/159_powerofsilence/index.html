Melody is beyond language, expressing moods which words cannot describe. Silence is yet higher.</p><p>The power to be silent at certain moments of life and of history is an important strength. It expresses the awareness that G‑d is infinite, and cannot be encapsulated in our human conceptions of what should take place.</p><p>The Talmud tells of an instance in which Moses himself was told by G‑d to be silent. G‑d showed him in a vision all future generations of the Jewish people, and the leaders of each generation. Moses was greatly impressed by the wisdom of Rabbi Akiva. Then he saw the way the Romans tortured him to death. &lsquo;Is this the reward of his Torah knowledge?&rsquo; Moses asked. G‑d answered: &lsquo;Be silent. Thus it arose in My thought.&rsquo;</p><p>This is not to say that the Torah advocates a fatalistic approach to life. Before the event, one must do everything possible to prevent tragedy. But once it has happened, G‑d forbid, through the acceptance and the silence we reach a special closeness to the Divine. Our sages tell us that because Aaron was silent, he was rewarded by G‑d speaking directly to him.&rdquo;</p><p>The soul&rsquo;s &ldquo;descent into this world to be clothed in a body and vital soul, &mldr; is for the sole purpose of perfecting them &mldr; to elevate his vital soul, together with the portion of the world at large that relates to it, binding and uniting them with the Ein Sof-light which he draws into them by performing all the 248 positive mitzvot through the agency of the vital soul&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, middle of Chapter 37)</p><p>&ldquo;In our generation, too, there is a need for this power of silence. It is not a passive power, but one that leads to vigorous and joyous action. The Jewish response to the harrowing events of the Shoah is the determined and energetic action to rebuild Jewish family life and Jewish knowledge.&rdquo; (Lubavitcher Rebbe, as above)</p><p>What must this &ldquo;vigorous and joyous action&rdquo; be in? It must be in the 248 positive mitzvos, especially those of action, those involving the agency of the vital soul.</p><p>&ldquo;Let Your work be revealed to Your servants, and Your splendor be upon their children.&rdquo; (Tehillim 90:16)</p><p>&ldquo;Through our power of silence we too, like Aaron, will merit Divine revelation. G‑d will bring the Messiah, rebuilding the Temple and bringing lasting peace to the world.&rdquo; (Lubavitcher Rebbe, as above)</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/160_bitultorah/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Bitul Torah</span></a>
