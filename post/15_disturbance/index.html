After all, everything is Providential.&rdquo; Indeed it is, explains the Baal Shem Tov: this man’s talk is a spark of the radiance of the Shechinah that has descended and now &ldquo;abides&rdquo; in his mouth in order that the worshipper should exert himself so strenuously that he will be able to ignore the disturbance.&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Iggeret HaKodesh, beginning of Epistle 25)</p><p>In the same way that we must realize the divine origin of a disturbance in prayer we must also realize the divine origin in any disturbance in our life. All comes from G-d, He just has &ldquo;many agents.&rdquo; There is no point in getting angry or obsessing with the agent. We should go straight to the source and work on our relationship with Hashem instead.</p><p>&ldquo;And Adam knew his wife again&rdquo; (Bereishit 4:25)</p><p>Similarly, Adam&rsquo;s third child came about through an unexpected agent. Lemech came to Adam and complained about his wives separating from him after he killed both Cain and Tubal-cain by accident. Adam reprimanded the wives and they replied, &ldquo;Correct yourself first. Haven’t you separated from your wife already 130 years since death was decreed because of you?&rdquo; Immediately Adam&rsquo;s desire for Eve became stronger than ever before. This is how Seth was born, and from him Enoch, a righteous man.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, O Lord, that Your judgments are just; righteously have You afflicted me.&rdquo; (Tehillim 119:75)</p><p>This verse in Tehillim links back to the Tanya portion above. There the Alter Rebbe quotes &ldquo;Whoever is in a rage resembles an idolater.&rdquo; He explains that, &ldquo;At the time of his (a man&rsquo;s) anger, faith in G-d and in His individual Divine Providence has left him, for were he to believe that what happened to him was G-d’s doing, he would not be angry at all.&rdquo; This is the true secret to growing in this world. When we take everything that happens to us as Hashem&rsquo;s just judgement and a chance to get closer to Him, we go above and beyond all disturbances from the outset. &ldquo;L&rsquo;chatchila Ariber&rdquo;</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/16_puremotives/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Pure Motives</span></a>
