<p>[The king of Philistia and his entourage] said [to Yitzchok], &ldquo;We have seen that the Lord was with you; so we said: Let there now be an oath between us, between ourselves and you, and let us form a covenant with you.&rdquo; (Bereishis 26:28)</p>
<p>In the end the Philistines approached Yitzchok to make peace. Like Yitzchok&rsquo;s efforts to dig wells, our most well-intentioned efforts can also sometimes yield unexpected results, actually strengthening the forces that oppose holiness rather than doing good. However, we learn from Yitzchok to not be discouraged in the face of such unexpected setbacks. Rather, we should continue our endeavors in good things, which are certain to eventually succeed. (Lubavitcher Rebbe)</p>
<p>&ldquo;See if there is a vexing way in me, then lead me in the way of the world.&rdquo; (Tehillim 139:24)</p>
<p>Hashem&rsquo;s door is always open for us to return. Sometimes we don&rsquo;t even notice it but somehow get off the way. We mean well but slowly, slowly we slip and fall into something unexpected. In those moments we must know that Hashem is with us, constantly checking us, and ready to assist us as soon as we let him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the statement there that Adam effected rectification (tikkun) through prayer as well, this means [that he did so] through uttering the letters of Speech, for the movement of one’s lips is also deemed a deed.&rdquo; (Kuntres Acharon, Essay 2)</p>
<p>The Alter Rebbe explains that good deeds effect a rectification in the world &ldquo;trimming and hacking off the thistles,&rdquo; the kelipot, which separate ourselves from Hashem. However, not only mitzvahs of action in the classical sense are able to achieve this tikkun. Adam was able to rectify his sins through prayer, because prayer uttered out loud is in essence a deed. It unifies one&rsquo;s G-dly soul, which by itself is incapable of uttering words of Torah or prayer, with the body. Heartfelt prayer uttered out loud is the entry to Hashem&rsquo;s door - which is always open.</p>
