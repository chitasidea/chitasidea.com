Thus the deeper significance of the commandment &lsquo;The breastplate shall not budge from the ephod&rsquo; (which ranks as one of the 365 prohibitions of the Torah) is that there must be no &lsquo;gap&rsquo; between the upper and lower aspects of life, or between its forward and backward elements. True, the human being consists of both the sensitive heart and the functional foot; true, life is composed of sublimely spiritual moments as well as the daily tending to one&rsquo;s material needs. But the &rsquo;ephod&rsquo; must be securely bound to the &lsquo;choshen.&rsquo; The upper must permeate the lower, and the external must never lose sight of its inner essence and purpose.&rdquo; (The Lubavitcher Rebbe)</p><p>This is the essential task that Chassidus lays out for us, but how do we make sure the external, the physical, doesn&rsquo;t lose sight of the spiritual inner essence and purpose?</p><p>&ldquo;Furthermore, not only by fighting his evil thoughts does one subdue the sitra achara, but even in matters that are fully permissible, every act of sacrificing one&rsquo;s impulse, even if only for a short while, i.e., if he delays partaking of even the permissible and essential with the intention of subduing the sitra achara in the left part of his heart, achieves this end.&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, middle of Chapter 27)</p><p>One of the tools at our disposal is the Avoda of Iskafya. By purposefully delaying physical gratification and filling this space with holiness instead, we cause a tremendous arousal to ascend on high, subduing not only the sitra achara, the absence of holiness, in our own lives but also in the entire world. For this reason we are also taught that moments of intense temptation are most opportune times to ask for blessings from above. When we fight to overcome temptation and at the same time ask for a blessing from above, it is almost guaranteed to come to fruition.</p><p>&ldquo;The seekers of my life have laid traps; those who seek my harm speak destructiveness; they utter deceits all day long. But I am like a deaf man, I do not hear; like a mute that does not open his mouth. I was like a man that does not perceive, and in whose mouth there are no rebuttals. Because for You, O L-rd, I wait; You will answer, my L-rd, my G-d.&rdquo; (Tehillim 38:13-16)</p><p>&ldquo;The seekers of my life&rdquo;–the evil temptations–&ldquo;have laid traps&rdquo;–at every turn they entice me to go down a hazardous path–&ldquo;they utter deceits all day long&rdquo;–promising that this one small thing won&rsquo;t sever my connection to the Creator. &ldquo;But I am like a deaf man, I do not hear&rdquo;–I am conscious that their words will only harm me and I don&rsquo;t listen to them–&ldquo;I was like a man that does not perceive&rdquo;–I completely ignored them–&ldquo;because for You, O L-rd, I wait&rdquo;–the fortitude to resist these major temptations came from delaying even permissible pleasures for the sake of Hashem. &ldquo;You will answer&rdquo;–with this minor sacrifice I can be assured that You will answer my prayer and guide me on may way.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/124_guidelight/><span>←</span><span>Guidelight</span></a>
