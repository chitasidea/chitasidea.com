In this endeavor is invested everything that Abraham possesses: all the resources—spiritual and material—with which the Almighty endows His people to the end of realizing His purpose in creation.&rdquo; (Lubavitcher Rebbe)</p><p>&ldquo;And even those commandments relating to thought or to the heart — such as the commandments regarding the love and awe of G-d, are also considered as physical acts — the commandments were given only to physical man in this [physical] world&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Iggeret HaKodesh, middle of Epistle 29)</p><p>When you really believe in Hashem it is not just an intellectual idea but a physical sensation. The Rebbe brings a story that the Alter Rebbe while davening (on Rosh Hashana or Yom Kippur) reached the words, &ldquo;Uvchen ten pachdecha&rdquo; he fell to the floor and couldn&rsquo;t finish the word &ldquo;pachdecha&rdquo; (&ldquo;trembling&rdquo;) (Likutei Sichos: Chayei-Sarah Vol. 1). Here we can also see that we must invest everything we have in our Avodas Hashem, because we are the only one&rsquo;s able to carry out His mission in the physical world.</p><p>&ldquo;He gave them the lands of nations, they inherited the toil of peoples, so that they might keep His statutes and observe His laws.&rdquo; (Tehillim 105:44-45)</p><p>Giving it our all is not just a one way street. &ldquo;G‑d is [also] willing to give up &lsquo;all His bounty&rsquo; to help each and every one of us fulfill our mission of bringing about the #marriage&rsquo; of the physical and the spiritual dimensions of reality by transforming the world into G‑d’s home through our good deeds&rdquo; (Lubavitcher Rebbe). As in this verse in Tehillim this help can sometimes take a very physical form, which enables us to carry out our mission in gashmius.</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/38_candle/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Candle</span></a>
