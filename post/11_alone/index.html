Rashi elaborates that &ldquo;every single individual [will dwell safely] - each man under his own vine and his own fig tree.&rdquo; This comes to teach us that when we are truly with Hashem our security is already guaranteed. No further measures are required to protect ourselves. We can live according to our own beliefs. As long as these align with Hashem&rsquo;s, our success is guaranteed.">

<p>&ldquo;And Israel dwelled safely and alone&rdquo; (Devarim 33:28)</p>
<p>Rashi elaborates that &ldquo;every single individual [will dwell safely] - each man under his own vine and his own fig tree.&rdquo; This comes to teach us that when we are truly with Hashem our security is already guaranteed. No further measures are required to protect ourselves. We can live according to our own beliefs. As long as these align with Hashem&rsquo;s, our success is guaranteed. As it says in Pirkei Avot 2:4 &ldquo;Make that His will should be your will, so that He should make your will to be as His will. Nullify your will before His will, so that He should nullify the will of others before your will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strengthening themselves vigorously, with all their might and power, against any internal or external obstacle&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Iggeret HaKodesh, middle of Epistle 22)</p>
<p>Our part is to strengthen ourselves in our connection to Hashem. To remove all obstacles, internal and external, that block us from connecting our innermost will to His innermost will. We pursue this specifically through the avodah of concentration in prayer, עיון תפלה.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The enemy shall not prevail over him, nor shall the iniquitous person afflict him.&rdquo; (Tehillim 89:23)</p>
<p>This verse in Psalms specifically speaks to those who have reached that level, Hashem&rsquo;s &ldquo;pious ones,&rdquo; who He is &ldquo;prepared [to assist]&rdquo; and &ldquo;strengthen&rdquo; with His &ldquo;arm.&rdquo; He &ldquo;will crush [their] adversaries before [them], and will strike down those who hate [them].&rdquo; (Tehillim 89:20-24)</p>
