It comes by virtue of our inheritance not to rebel against G‑d, the King of kings. This level of fear can therefore always be present.</p><p>&ldquo;And the Kohen who is anointed or who is invested to serve in his father&rsquo;s stead, shall effect [this] atonement, and he shall don the linen garments, the holy garments&rdquo; (Vayikra 16:32)</p><p>Rashi explains the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;in his father&rsquo;s stead&rdquo; : &ldquo;This teaches us that if his son can take his place [meaning that he is his equal], he takes precedence over everyone else.&rdquo; We thus see the importance and power of inheritance between father and son, specifically, and the Jewish people in general. Our relationship to Hashem comes by way of a gift which he &ldquo;uniquely bestows &mldr; upon us&rdquo; (Tanya, as above). This gift transcends any person&rsquo;s intellect, and therefore serves first and foremost, over and above any personal merits, as the foundation of our relationship to the Creator of the world.</p><p>&ldquo;Before I afflicted myself, I would blunder; but now I observe Your word.&rdquo; (Tehillim 119:67)</p><p>It goes without saying that the above is not a punishment from shomayim, chaz ve shalom, that we must endure all the Heavenly decrees against our will because we accepted the &ldquo;yoke of Heaven.&rdquo; Exactly the opposite, we must realize that to observe Hashem&rsquo;s word is our greatest gift. Through it we can distance ourselves from all the difficulties that, in truth, we only afflict upon ourselves. By straying from His path we make ourselves dependent on our limited intellect, which sooner or later will cause us to blunder. Instead, we must affirm to follow Hashem&rsquo;s word, even against our initial inclination, with the certainty that only good will come from it.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/188_pursuitpleasure/><span>←</span><span>Pursuit & Pleasure</span></a>
