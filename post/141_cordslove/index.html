Nonetheless, the names of Jacob&rsquo;s sons were inscribed on the Ephod&rsquo;s two shoulder stones in the order of their birth, rather than in the order of their importance or prestige. This underscores their common, unifying factor – the fact that they are all Jacob&rsquo;s sons.</p><p>Jacob was the only patriarch whose children all remained faithful to the Divine mission and ideology that Abraham began. All of Jacob&rsquo;s sons learned how to channel their individual differences and strengths toward perpetuating Judaism. This unity made their inscribed names a source of merit for us as the high priest entered the Tabernacle to represent us before G‑d. Just as parents are happy to grant their children&rsquo;s wishes when they all cooperate lovingly, G‑d is more ready to shower us with His beneficence when we follow in the footsteps of Jacob&rsquo;s sons and unite in our devotion to the ideals of Judaism.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hillel said, &lsquo;Be one of the disciples of Aharon, loving peace and pursuing peace, loving creatures and drawing them near to the Torah.&rsquo; This means that even those who are far from G‑d&rsquo;s Torah and His service, for which reason they are classified simply as &lsquo;creatures&rsquo; one must attract with strong cords of love.&rdquo;</p><p>Even those whose only merit is that they are G‑d&rsquo;s creations we are obligated to love and draw near. And as the Tanya continues, &ldquo;Even if one fails [to draw them close to the Torah], he has not forfeited the merit of the mitzvah of neighborly love, which he has fulfilled by his efforts in this direction,&rdquo; thereby creating the unity that the Rebbe explains above is so crucial to drawing Divine favor upon the Jewish people.</p><p>&ldquo;A song of ascents, by David. Behold, how good and how pleasant it is when brothers dwell together &mldr; Like the dew of Hermon which comes down upon the mountains of Zion, for there the L‑rd has commanded blessing, life unto eternity.&rdquo; (Tehillim 133:1&amp;3)</p><p>It is good and pleasant when brothers dwell together, it is like the dew of Hermon, because in it is the L‑rd&rsquo;s blessing. When the people of Israel are joined together through &ldquo;strong cords of love&rdquo; they elicit tremendous Divine blessing and favor, more than the strictest individual observance of mitzvos or the deepest study of Torah ever could.</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/142_belovedtreasure/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Beloved Treasure</span></a>
