All are equally dear to Hashem. All are His will and as such entirely one with Him. When we study or engage in, what seems to us, even the most repulsive of mitzvos, we bring great delight above, in worlds so high that not even our G‑dly soul reaches there.</p><p>&ldquo;By David. Do not compete with the wicked; do not envy doers of injustice.&rdquo; (Tehillim 37:1)</p><p>David HaMelech was the embodiment of humility and bittul to Hashem. He never looked to the wicked, to compete with them and envy their comforts. He rejoiced only in Hashem&rsquo;s precepts, which he described as &ldquo;perfect, restoring the soul&rdquo; (Tehillim 19:8). As it says in Talmud, Berachot 4a:</p><p>&ldquo;Thus spoke King David before G‑d: Master of the world, am I not pious? All the kings of the east and the west sit with all their pomp among their company, whereas my hands are soiled with the blood of menstruation, with the fetus and the placenta, in order to declare a woman clean for her husband. And what is more, in all that I do I consult my teacher, Mephibosheth, and I say to him: My teacher Mephibosheth, is my decision right? Did I correctly convict, correctly acquit, correctly declare clean, correctly declare unclean? And I am not ashamed.&rdquo;</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/174_taharashamishpacha/><span>←</span><span>Taharas Hamishpacha</span></a>
