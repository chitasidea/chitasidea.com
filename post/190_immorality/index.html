I am the L‑rd.&rdquo; (Vayikra 18:6)</p><p>One might ask: What do these severe forms of sexual immorality have to do with us today? Why does the Torah, which is relevant to all Jews in all times and all places, dwell for so many verses on the minute details of the forbidden forms of intimate relations? First of all, homosexuality, forbidden by the Torah (Vayikra 18:22) and deemed a תוֹעֵבָה, an abomination, over and above the transgressions involving incestuous relationships detailed in this portion, has become widely accepted in modern society. Furthermore, Hashem commands us in the next Parashah: &ldquo;You shall be holy, for I, the L‑rd, your G‑d, am holy&rdquo; (Vayikra 19:2). A large part of our holiness stems from the way we channel our most potent source of energy, our sense of sensuality. As such, even merely distancing ourselves from the forbidden a little more is already considered a great merit.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Likewise, when he goes to sleep, he longs and yearns for his soul to be restored to him when he awakens from his sleep. So do I long and yearn to draw within me the infinite light of the blessed Ein Sof, the Life of true life, through engaging in the [study of the] Torah when I awaken during the night from my sleep&rsquo;, for the Torah and the Holy One, blessed be He, are one and the same.&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, beginning of Chapter 44)</p><p>Hashem, whose Torah and Him are &ldquo;one and the same,&rdquo; wants us to study the minutia of which relationships are forbidden according to the Torah, under which conditions and from which verses exactly. Hashem wants us to consciously distance ourselves from all the &ldquo;practice of the land of Egypt&rdquo; and all the &ldquo;practice of the land of Canaan&rdquo; (Vayikra 18:3)–which most commentators interpret to refer to immoral sexual behavior–by drawing down &ldquo;the infinite light of the blessed Ein Sof, the Life of true life through engaging in the study of the Torah.&rdquo; Even if we are currently far removed from the heinous acts described in this portion, there is no guarantee that society will not descend to this level of impurity as we approach the coming of Moshiach, may it be soon. Therefore we must actively engage with all the lessons contained in these verses and strengthen ourselves constantly in all areas of moral behavior.</p><p>&ldquo;I will bow toward Your Holy Sanctuary, and praise Your Name for Your kindness and for Your truth; for You have exalted Your word above all Your Names.&rdquo; (Tehillim 138:2)</p><p>Hashem exalted His Torah, His &ldquo;word,&rdquo; above all His Names. It is our lifeboat. It is our shining light. It provides us with clarity on the right way forward under all conditions. Even if everything around us turns into chaos, we always have clear guidance and a ultimate final word in all our decisions. We must stay true to its directives, even under the difficult conditions of this generation, because it is all a preparation for the imminent coming of Moshiach, when we will finally behold how &ldquo;My children &mldr; all that I have done I did not do except for your sake&rdquo; (Yalkut Shimoni).</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/191_absolutetruth/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Absolute Truth</span></a>
