Chassidus centers around this concept. We can&rsquo;t be one thing outside the house and another inside. Our fear of G-d must permeate our entire life, into the innermost recesses of our heart and the most private parts of our lives. From here derives also the concept that a chossid must be a &ldquo;messudar.">

<h1>Messudar</h1>

<p>&ldquo;I shall walk with the innocence of my heart [even] within my house.&rdquo; (Tehillim 101:2)</p>
<p>Chassidus centers around this concept. We can&rsquo;t be one thing outside the house and another inside. Our fear of G-d must permeate our entire life, into the innermost recesses of our heart and the most private parts of our lives. From here derives also the concept that a chossid must be a &ldquo;messudar.&rdquo; Good intentions can only come to fruition when we have our lives under control. When we wake up every day and cover our basic mitzvos: prayer, warmness with others, control over our thoughts, tzedakah, and learning Chitas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He appeared from Mount Paran and came with some of the holy myriads&rdquo; (Devarim 33:2)</p>
<p>Rashi explains this verse: &ldquo;With God were only some of the myriads of His holy angels, but not all of them, nor [even] most of them. This is unlike the manner of a mortal, who displays all the splendor of his riches and his glory on his wedding day.&rdquo; Here we can see that the quality of self-restraint is also present in Hashem. We have the obligation to seek to emulate Him, by controlling our natural urges and concentrating our energies in the right direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as to causing an indwelling of G-d’s holiness, [the individual] cannot be compared to [the congregation] at all.&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Iggeret HaKodesh, beginning of Epistle 23)</p>
<p>Still we must know that being a messudar is not for our own sake. It is only a means to an end to do our part in building a strong community, with Torah, mitzvos and ahavos chinam.</p>
