From this we learn that the love and fear of G‑d necessary to perform Torah and mitzvos are accessible to all. It is possible for all to not necessarily divest themselves from the pleasures of the world, but to reorient them towards holiness, like the offerings which must be brought at the Mishkan, not in the &ldquo;open field.&rdquo; Specifically &ldquo;peace offerings,&rdquo; mentioned later on in this context, are offerings from which even the person bringing them may benefit, representing the kind of pleasure which is not wholly divested from physicality but still aimed towards holiness.</p><p>&ldquo;How sweet are Your words to my palate, [sweeter] than honey to my mouth!&rdquo; (Tehillim 119:103)</p><p>Still, even when we have not reached the level yet where all our pleasures are the Glory of Hashem alone, or even when not all our physical pleasures are directed towards holiness, we must observe His words, and actively work on making them our foremost pursuit and pleasure.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=next href=https://chitasidea.com/post/187_kabbolasol/><span>Kabbolas Ol</span><span>→</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class=footer><p><a rel=license href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></p></footer></body></html>
