We cannot rely on our previous achievements to inspire us and lead our way. Neither can we rely on other people to watch over us and pull us along. Instead we must rouse ourselves, from the deepest depths of our being, to love Hashem with all our heart and with all our wealth, specifically while saying the daily Shema. In this way we will draw inspiration of our &ldquo;own accord&rdquo; from the unlimited source up above.</p><p>&ldquo;My soul is in danger always, yet I have not forgotten Your Torah.&rdquo; (Tehillim 119:109)</p><p>We must live every day with the knowledge that our soul is in acute danger in this dark world. When we enter a comfortable routine and start holding at one level we are entering into an illusion, our soul has already began sinking at that moment. We must never stop increasing our efforts to fulfill mitzvos behidur, learn with concentration, and daven b&rsquo;iyun.</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/42_strife/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Strife</span></a>
