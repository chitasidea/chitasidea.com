Action to spread G-dliness in this world and free the last sparks of holiness holding the world back from redemption. On this mission we cannot afford distractions.</p><p>&ldquo;But he tarried, and the men took hold of his hand and his wife&rsquo;s hand, and the hand of his two daughters&rdquo; (Bereishis, 19:16)</p><p>We see the opposite in Lot. When the angels came to save Lot, he delayed &ldquo;in order to save his possessions&rdquo; (Rashi, from Gen. Rabbah 50:11). It was only because of Hashem&rsquo;s &ldquo;pity for him&rdquo; that they still took him out of the city.</p><p>&ldquo;But I am poor and needy; hurry to me, O G-d! You are my help and deliverer; O G-d, do not delay!&rdquo; (Tehillim 70:6)</p><p>When we fulfill our mission with alacrity, Hashem will in turn also hurry to our side when we need Him. In truth, we are in need of Hashem&rsquo;s assistance our entire lives. Every breath we take is only by the grace of Hashem, and the incredible ingenuity with which He designed nature and our bodies. How much more so does that mean we should rush to fulfill His will when He desires our &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; (in bring G-dliness to this world)?</p><p>As it says in Pirkei Avot 4:2 &ldquo;Run to pursue a minor mitzvah, and flee from a transgression. For a mitzvah brings another mitzvah, and a transgression brings another transgression. For the reward of a mitzvah is a mitzvah, and the reward of transgression is transgression.&rdquo; Every mitzvah we do creates an angel in our favor that pulls us in the direction of further mitzvot and helps us on our mission.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/31_chargingstation/><span>←</span><span>Charging Station</span></a>
