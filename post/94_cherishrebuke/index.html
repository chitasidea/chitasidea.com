For as long [as I live], my prayer is [to preserve me] from their harm.&rdquo;</p><p>Sometimes, however, the prospective beinoni gets a gift from above in the form of rebuke from a righteous person. This can serve to take out much badness from his life with sometimes even a minor correction of behavior and self-reflection.</p><p>&ldquo;So Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh and said to him, &lsquo;So said the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me?&rsquo;&rdquo; (Shemos 10:3)</p><p>As such, one must cherish every rebuke and the ensuing moments of self-reflection. They are like a knowledge-packed shiur which allows one to step into the world of a more learned person and receive perfectly condensed and arranged wisdom from him. Therefore, we should be quick to humble ourselves and accept the gentle rebuke of an honest person, with an open heart and determination to implement any insights that may come of it.</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/95_tzaddikimpelz/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Tzaddik im Pelz</span></a>
