The inherent closeness of a father and child makes it impossible for the father to reign over his child. Therefore Hashem must conceal our divine origin from us, so we can fully accept his sovereignty. As a result of this concealment we can loose sight of our true nature and the true nature of our relationship with G-d.</p><p>&ldquo;For the Lord is most high, awesome; a great King over all the earth&rdquo; (Tehillim 47:3)</p><p>It is impossible for Hashem and us to &ldquo;live together.&rdquo; There can&rsquo;t be any confusion. Hashem is the king and we are the subject, Hashem is the master and we are the servant, Hashem is father and we are the son. There must be a hierarchy, clarity. Yom Kippur is our chance to press the &ldquo;reset&rdquo; button on our relationship. To purify our heart to serve him in truth.</p><p>Inspiration: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sG4hXFyr1QM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sG4hXFyr1QM</a></p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/06_torahvsmitzvos/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Torah vs. Mitzvos</span></a>
