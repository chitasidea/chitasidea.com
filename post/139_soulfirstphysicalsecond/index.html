True love can only exist between those who view their souls as primary, recognizing their common origin in the one Creator above. The more the spiritual is emphasized over the physical, the less barriers exist between people and in their service to G‑d, because there are no separations at all between souls, not between each other and not between them and G‑d, for &ldquo;they are actually all equal&rdquo; and &ldquo;they all have one father."><meta name=author content><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://chitasidea.com/app.min.css><link rel=preload as=image href=https://chitasidea.com/theme.png><link rel=preload as=image href=https://chitasidea.com/signal.svg><link rel=preload as=image href=https://chitasidea.com/whatsapp.svg><link rel=preload as=image href=https://chitasidea.com/email.svg><link rel=icon href=https://chitasidea.com/favicon.ico><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://chitasidea.com/apple-touch-icon.png><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.94.0"><meta property="og:title" content="Soul First, Physical Second"><meta property="og:description" content="24 Adar I 5782 &ldquo;Therefore, there can be no true love and fraternity between those who regard their bodies as primary and their souls secondary but only a love based on an external factor.&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, middle of Chapter 32)

The more the spiritual is emphasized over the physical, the less barriers exist between people and in their service to G‑d, because there are no separations at all between souls, not between each other and not between them and G‑d, for &ldquo;they are actually all equal&rdquo; and &ldquo;they all have one father.&rdquo; Therefore, as soon as we give the soul primary importance in our lives, our entire outlook on life, G‑d, and other people changes. Everything falls into place and reaches to new depths of clarity and illumination.</p><p>&ldquo;[G‑d] made the Menorah out of pure gold.&rdquo; (Shemos 37:17)</p><p>With, and only with, the recognition that the soul comes first and the physical comes second, we can now proceed to our individual paths of divine service. The Rebbe explains that, &ldquo;The seven lamps of the Menorah signify the seven basic types of Jewish souls. Each type has its particular path in revealing Divinity, based on the seven basic emotions: (1) the love of G‑d, (2) the awe of G‑d, (3) connecting to G‑d through studying the Torah, (4) overcoming obstacles opposing G‑dliness in the world, (5) appreciating G‑d&rsquo;s goodness, (6) the pride in being G‑d&rsquo;s emissary in the world, and (7) humility.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I shall walk before the L‑rd in the lands of the living.&rdquo; (Tehillim 116:9)</p><p>As long as we are alive we must go on these paths before G‑d. That is to say, each of us has our individual way of bringing G‑dliness to the world, and we must incorporate all our efforts in it, to go with fire and determination towards our one goal of bringing Moshiach, quickly and completely.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/140_suspendingdaas/><span>←</span><span>Suspending Daas</span></a>
