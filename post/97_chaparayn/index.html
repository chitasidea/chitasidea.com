How much more so when we manage to carry them out with a degree of revealed love—of &ldquo;fiery flames, with a desire and a longing and a passion manifestly felt&rdquo;—each according to his ability.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/98_trifecta/><span>←</span><span>Trifecta</span></a>
