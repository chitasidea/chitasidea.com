Following Jacob’s example, we can adopt the same joyful and confident attitude when we set out to tackle life&rsquo;s numerous daily, mundane activities, even though they may not seem as spiritual.&rdquo; (Lubavitcher Rebbe)</p><p>&ldquo;One thing I have asked of the Lord, this I seek: that I may dwell in the House of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the pleasantness of the Lord, and to visit His Sanctuary.&rdquo; (Tehillim 27:4)</p><p>&ldquo;The key is to make sure beforehand that, like Jacob, we are properly nourished (by studying the Torah), properly clothed (by observing G‑d’s commandments), and properly focused on our goal (of making the world into G‑d’s home)&rdquo; (Lubavitcher Rebbe). This is what David describes in this verse in Tehillim. He says &ldquo;It is not wars that I desire, for I cannot gain perfection with them. Only one thing do I ask: to abide day and night in the study hall studying Torah, to gain perfection so that my soul may merit the life of the World to Come.&rdquo; Eventhough I am engaged in mundane affairs, even with great success, I always place before me my greatest desire, to cleave to You.</p><p>&ldquo;The standing of the practical mitzvot and their study far transcends the standing of intellect, meaning intellectually generated awe and love&rdquo; (Kuntres Acharon, middle of Essay 4)</p><p>Going into our day well prepared, as described above, we need to keep in mind that what we are about to do is the true purpose of creation. The practical mitzvos we encounter throughout the day - sanctifying the divine name with our behavior, being righteous in business, spreading positivity - allow us to cleave to G-d&rsquo;s very essence. Even when all we do is work, the tzedakah we give from its fruits uplifts our labors to holiness.</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/48_honor/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Honor</span></a>
