We must respectfully and resolutely decline, with the certainty that this culture, like all others that came before it, will in the end vanish.</p><p>Only our way, that of the Torah, will persevere. It will continue to give us life, no matter what the world around us looks like, and which cultural or political movement is currently on the rise. This certainty is the &ldquo;staff of G-d&rdquo; in our hand.</p><p>&ldquo;The time [of prayer] is propitious for every man to ascend to a higher spiritual level.&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, middle of Chapter 12)</p><p>We gain this certainty during our daily prayer, in which we - through careful preparation and tenacious concentration - connect with Hashem, binding our intellectual faculties, consisting of chochmah, binah, and daat to Him. We then bring this concentration into our daily life - our minor interactions, our business, our family - spreading positivity and awareness of the one true G-d.</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/88_everywhereornowhere/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Everywhere or Nowhere</span></a>
