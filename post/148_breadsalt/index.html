This means that he directs all his efforts and uses all resources at his disposal to glorify and brighten G‑d&rsquo;s presence in the world through his good deeds. Just like the sacrifices in the times of the Holy Temple, today &ldquo;the animal and vegetable food that we eat is our own personal &lsquo;sacrifice,&rsquo; since by eating it, we transform it into the fuel that enables us to fulfill G‑d&rsquo;s commandments, thereby elevating it into holiness.&rdquo; (Daily Wisdom, as above)</p><p>&ldquo;He gathers the waters of the sea like a mound; He places the deep waters in vaults.&rdquo; (Tehillim 33:7)</p><p>Rashi explains, &ldquo;When G‑d separated the supernal waters from the lower waters, He made a covenant with the lower waters that their salt will be offered on the altar.&rdquo; Nowadays, when we don&rsquo;t have an &ldquo;official&rdquo; altar, &ldquo;our tables are our own personal &lsquo;altars.&rsquo; Traditionally, the bread that we eat is first dipped in salt. In this way, we elevate all four kingdoms of creation at our table, just as they were in the sacrifices.&rdquo; (Daily Wisdom, as above)</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/149_gdsbread/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>G‑d's Bread</span></a>
