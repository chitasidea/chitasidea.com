We may think that we are being dishonest with ourselves. Considering all our faults, we may feel that our connection to G‑d is not real, that our efforts to advance spiritually are ultimately futile.&rdquo; (Lubavitcher Rebbe)</p><p>&ldquo;Every Jew, whether righteous or wicked, possesses two souls&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, end of Chapter 1)</p><p>In these moments of doubt we must remember &ldquo;that every Jew, whether righteous or wicked, possesses two souls.&rdquo; One that pulls him towards G-dliness and one that pulls him towards the material. Until Moshiach comes these two realities can and must coexist. Although now, before Moshiach comes, our actions may seem hypocritical at times, we should not become disheartened. We must strive to live as consistently as possible, not giving up because of momentary lapses.
