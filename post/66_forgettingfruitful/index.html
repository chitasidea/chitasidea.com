Joseph named his second son Ephraim (&lsquo;he will be fruitful&rsquo;) in order to emphasize that our purpose in the world is to influence it positively&rdquo; (Lubavitcher Rebbe). Exile forces us to unite two seemingly contradictory approaches. On the one hand we must reject all the negative influences of this world, never forgetting our lofty origin, on the other hand we must engage deeply with the world&rsquo;s most physical aspects. The key is that these are two distinct phases, one preceding the other. First we maintain our values and then we engage with the world.</p><p>&ldquo;The souls of the Patriarchs and of Moses our Teacher are by far superior to the souls of our own generations, [which belong to] the period preceding the coming of the Messiah, for [the latter souls] are like the very soles of the feet in comparison with the brain and the head.&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, Chapter 2)</p><p>Exile is just going to become darker before it gets light. Every generation is more distant from the giving of the Torah. Every generation of souls represents one further descent in the chain-like order of Hishtalshelus. This is the explicit will of Hashem not something to feel bad about. Therefore we sometimes have to live with our own limitations, albeit never forgetting where they descend from and never giving up working on them.</p><p>&ldquo;Wage my battle and redeem me; grant me life for the sake of Your word.&rdquo; (Tehillim 119:154)</p><p>Hashem redeems us, not we Him. In the end it is up to Him not up to us. All we can do is give our best each and every day, increasing our joy in the anticipation of what is to come.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/67_selflessvisionarytrusting/><span>←</span><span>Selfless, Visionary, Trusting</span></a>
