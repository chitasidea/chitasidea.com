In a letter dated 25 Adar, 5710 [1950], six weeks after the passing of the Rebbe Rayatz, he elaborates on this verse: &ldquo;In order that those benefactions should be received and intimately integrated into the souls of those recipients, their &ldquo;vessels&rdquo; (i.e., their spiritual receptive capabilities) need to be ever more finely attuned.&rdquo; This is not only true for the benefactions of a tzaddik, as covered in this letter, but of all blessings. In order to make ourselves receptive to the revealed good, we need to constantly and evermore finely attune ourselves.</p><p>Letter: <a href=https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/96061/jewish/Beis-Nissan-From-Strength-to-Strength.htm>https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/96061/jewish/Beis-Nissan-From-Strength-to-Strength.htm</a></p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/11_alone/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Alone</span></a>
