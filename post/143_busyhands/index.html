Sometimes we may face a challenge and say, &ldquo;How can this be done by a mere human like myself?&rdquo; Says G‑d, &ldquo;<em>You be busy with your hands!</em> I&rsquo;ll do the rest.

Hashem runs the world, everything is nothing in His presence, as we read every day in Pesukei Dezimra, &ldquo;Wealth and honor come from You, and You rule over all; in Your hand are might and power, and it is in Your hand to grant greatness and strength to all.&rdquo; (I Chronicles 29:10-13)</p><p>&ldquo;Rescue me and deliver me from the hand of strangers, whose mouth speaks deceit and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.&rdquo; (Tehillim 144:11)</p><p>By refusing to fall victim to the plots of the yetzer hara &ldquo;whose mouth speaks deceit,&rdquo; making us feel like our accomplishments come from our own strength, &ldquo;and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood,&rdquo; who tries to make us into his right hand to carry out evil falsehood in the world, we will make a firm separation between good and evil in our heart, withdrawing more and more life-force from the sitra achara, until the final redemption, may it be soon, may it be in our lifetime.</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/144_creatingenvironment/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Creating an Environment</span></a>
