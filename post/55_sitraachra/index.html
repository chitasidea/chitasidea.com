Earlier Esau assured Yaakov that, &ldquo;What you have remain yours.&rdquo; To explain his generosity he, unlike Yaakov, spoke haughtily, saying &ldquo;I have plenty,&rdquo; [meaning] much more than I need. Yaakov made a similar statement of generosity, however, in it he humbled himself, saying &ldquo;I have everything,&rdquo; all my necessities. Even the smallest deeds, miniscule changes in wording, can derive either from holiness or the Sitra Achra, it is our choice.</p><p>&ldquo;O my God, rescue me from the hand of the wicked, from the palm of the scheming and violent.&rdquo; (Tehillim 71:4)</p><p>On the way to achieving such close adherence to the will of Hashem we need a lot of support. It is not in our power to free ourselves from the &ldquo;hand of the wicked&rdquo; inclination all by ourselves. Therefore we need to actively ask Hashem for assistance. In combination with our sincere efforts Hashem is certain to grant us success, as the Chapter in Tehillim ends, &ldquo;Those who seek my harm are shamed and disgraced.&rdquo;</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/56_exactness/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Exactness</span></a>
