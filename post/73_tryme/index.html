Only with &ldquo;concentration&rdquo; of the intellect, can we truly put our mind and heart into the service of Hashem. Only then does it become &ldquo;food for the soul.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Try me, O Lord, and test me; refine my mind and heart.&rdquo; (Tehillim 26:2)</p><p>The end-goal is to transform all the trials and tribulations Hashem puts in our way into refinements of our selves. When we turn everything that happens to us into a lesson that strengthens our mind&rsquo;s and heart&rsquo;s focus on Hashem, we will merit to learn with concentration, embracing Torah with our being, and enclothing ourselves and our actions with the spirit of G-dliness.</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/74_one/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>One</span></a>
