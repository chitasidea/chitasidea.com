As the Alter Rebbe explains it is difficult to overcome, for &ldquo;Timtum halev (coldness of the heart) must be eradicated by removing its underlying cause &mldr; rather than overwhelmed by increasing the intellectual light of contemplation on the greatness of G‑d.&rdquo; At this point we might become disheartened, thinking that our entire spiritual service consists of one challenge after another.</p><p>&ldquo;For seven days you shall perform atonement upon the altar and sanctify it. Henceforth, the altar shall be a holy of holies. Whatever touches the altar will be holy.&rdquo; (Shemos 29:37)</p><p>This Parashah teaches us that it is not so. Any sacrifice, even if it was disqualified during the offering process, automatically became holy when placed upon the altar in so far that it must not be taken down from the altar. The rule however applies only to things that are worthy of being brought upon the Altar in the first place. We can infer from this also a lesson for us. When our service was initially with the right intentions, but became &ldquo;disqualified&rdquo; along the way, it is still sanctified by the mere contact with holiness in so far that we must not abandon it.</p><p>&ldquo;But to the wicked, G‑d said, &lsquo;What does it help you to discuss My laws, and bear My covenant upon your lips? For you hate discipline, and throw My words behind you.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Tehillim 50:16-17)</p><p>We must continue to try and try, with great discipline and without regards to our &ldquo;overall progress,&rdquo; because these challenges are a beinoni&rsquo;s very way of service. By battling them and eventually succeeding, he brings tremendous joy above, which elicits even greater blessing to flow down below.</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/127_honestyinbusiness/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Honesty in Business</span></a>
