He therefore resembles a brutish man, a fool who cannot comprehend the lofty nature of the Torah and mitzvot. Because, in his mind, the reward remains concealed, the effort becomes ever harder. He must therefore constantly struggle to keep himself on the right way. Thankfully, Chassidus teaches us how to align ourselves with the cosmic reality above, and see every mitzvah for what it really is, a gift from above, in and of itself, with infinite reward in tow.</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/208_rewardworld/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Reward in This World</span></a>
