Keeping this knowledge in mind enables us to study the Torah and fulfill G‑d&rsquo;s commandments with enthusiasm, joy, and purpose.&rdquo; (Daily Wisdom, continued from above)</p><p>&ldquo;How great are Your works, O L‑rd; how very profound Your thoughts! A brutish man cannot know, a fool cannot comprehend this&rdquo; (Tehillim 92:6-7)</p><p>One who doesn&rsquo;t meditate on the above makes himself blind to how great are Hashem&rsquo;s works. He therefore resembles a brutish man, a fool who cannot comprehend the lofty nature of the Torah and mitzvot. Because, in his mind, the reward remains concealed, the effort becomes ever harder. He must therefore constantly struggle to keep himself on the right way. Thankfully, Chassidus teaches us how to align ourselves with the cosmic reality above, and see every mitzvah for what it really is, a gift from above, in and of itself, with infinite reward in tow.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/208_rewardworld/><span>←</span><span>Reward in This World</span></a>
