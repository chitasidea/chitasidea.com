All of these do not deviate from their Divinely intended purpose but obey G-d&rsquo;s command. Although they cannot perceive it, for the animal cannot perceive G-d&rsquo;s command, yet their &lsquo;spirit&rsquo; perceives it.&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, Chapter 24)</p><p>You must realize that your animal soul is performing precisely according to its Divinely intended purpose, to protect your physical well-being at all costs. It is interpreting your spiritual advancements as dangerous excursions that could lead to all kinds of physical harm and self-neglect. Your job now is to convince it of the opposite, as the Rebbe puts it, &ldquo;you should work with it, strengthening its health while &rsquo;educating&rsquo; it to realize that accepting the Torah&rsquo;s dictates is in its own best interest&rdquo; (Daily Wisdom).</p><p>&ldquo;What is the matter with you, O sea, that you flee; Jordan, that you turn backward; mountains, that you skip like rams; hills, like young sheep? [We do so] before the Master, the Creator of the earth, before the G-d of Jacob&rdquo; (Tehillim 114:5-7)</p><p>Like the mountains and hills that skip like rams and sheep, before the revelation Hashem, once your animal soul realizes the higher source of your spiritual endeavors, it too will act against its own nature of physicality and selfishness. It too will view the mitzvos &ldquo;as a gift, joining your soul enthusiastically in their fulfillment&rdquo; (Daily Wisdom).</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/114_bribes/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Bribes</span></a>
