King David assures us, from his own personal experience, that Hashem is not keen to cast us away to be forsaken. When we put our trust in Hashem, He will protect us from ourselves, even when we set out on the wrong path.

He wants us to go on the right path from the outset and stay on it. In these Ten Days of Repentance we should keep in mind that everything we do is in cooperation with Hashem, and even our smallest efforts will be assisted and sustained by Him.</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/04_tzimtzum/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Tzimtzum</span></a>
