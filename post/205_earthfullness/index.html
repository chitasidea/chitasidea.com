It is here that a Jew is able, through his divine service, to effect the subjugation of evil and the pre-eminence of light supplanting darkness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And they will know that You, Whose Name is the L‑rd, are alone, Most High over all the earth.&rdquo; (Tehillim 83:19)</p><p>How does a Jew accomplish the above? By using all his spiritual and physical powers in serving G‑d, overcoming all obstacles in his way, even those inherent in the world&rsquo;s very nature, just as G‑d Himself overcame all obstacles to creating this world in the first place. This of course includes using his physical possessions, his material wealth, as a tool to subjugate the sitra achara, thereby incorporating the kelipot into holiness and bringing about the ultimate purpose of creation, for the &ldquo;earth and its fullness&rdquo; to be G‑d&rsquo;s in a revealed way.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=next href=https://chitasidea.com/post/204_bunim/><span>Rabbi Bunim of Pshischa</span><span>→</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class=footer><p><a rel=license href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></p></footer></body></html>
