<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, such sadness is due to conceit, for he does not know his place, and that is why he is distressed, because he has not attained the level of a tzaddik&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, middle of Chapter 27)</p>
<p>Sadness about lowly thoughts does not stem from honest frustration in not serving Hashem properly, but from a person&rsquo;s mistaken desire to be a tzaddik instead of desiring to be a &ldquo;beinoni and not a rasha for even a single moment throughout his life.&rdquo; If he knew his actual station, he would be rejoicing in the opportunity to defeat a negative thought and progress further in his task of being a beinoni.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you shall place it beneath the ledge of the altar from below, and the net shall [extend downward] until the middle of the altar.&rdquo; (Shemos 27:5)</p>
<p>Rashi uses this verse to expound further on the furnishings and arrangement of the Mishkan. He explains, &ldquo;The ramp was to the south of the altar, separated from the altar by a hairbreadth. Its base reached [until] a cubit adjacent to the hangings of the courtyard on the Mishkan&rsquo;s southern [side].&rdquo; We thus see that every item in the Mishkan had its precise location and orientation. No part of the Mishkan was trying to be something else or trying to fulfill anything but its intended purpose. All they were &ldquo;trying&rdquo; to do was be the best and most complete versions of themselves.</p>
<p>A classic Hasidic story tells about the great Reb Zusha, who was found agitated and upset as he lay on deathbed. His students asked, &ldquo;Rebbe, why are you so sad? After all the great things you have accomplished, your place in heaven is assured!&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid!&rdquo; Zusha replied, &ldquo;Because when I get to heaven, G‑d won&rsquo;t ask me &lsquo;Why weren&rsquo;t you more like Moses?&rsquo; or &lsquo;Why weren&rsquo;t you more like King David?&rsquo; G‑d will ask &lsquo;Zusha, why weren&rsquo;t you more like Zusha?&rsquo; And then what will I say!?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not transgressed against my G‑d; for all His laws are before me, I have not removed His statutes from me.&rdquo; (Tehillim 18:22-23)</p>
<p>So, how is one to achieve the lofty goal of fulfilling one&rsquo;s potential? By constantly putting the words of G‑d before oneself, His laws and His statutes, delving deeply into them with enthusiasm, never backing down on previous accomplishments or resting from one&rsquo;s established regimen, especially in the study of Chassidus or Mussar.</p>
