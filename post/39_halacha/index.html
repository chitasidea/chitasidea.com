<h1>Halacha</h1>
</header>
<section class=post-content><h5 id=23-cheshvan-5782>23 Cheshvan 5782</h5>
<p>&ldquo;And to the sons of Abraham&rsquo;s concubines, Abraham gave gifts&rdquo; (Bereishis 25:6)</p>
<p>Rashi explains that Abraham gave them &ldquo;all that was given to him because of Sarah and the other gifts that were given to him &mldr; for he did not wish to benefit from them.&rdquo; In Kitzur Shulchan Oruch Chapter 29 &ldquo;Moral and Ethical Rules Which a Person Should Adopt&rdquo; it says, &ldquo;It is the practice of pious people, not to accept gifts, but to trust that Hashem, will take care of their needs.&rdquo; Many question arise about this Halacha, specifically because Abraham, our role model for piety, accepted gifts on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The halachot are referred to as a &lsquo;crown&rsquo; and the &lsquo;crown of the Torah,&rsquo; for they reveal the supernal will, which is at the level of keter.&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Iggeret HaKodesh, end of Epistle 29)</p>
<p>Through the above Rashi, we can now retroactively see that Abraham too appreciated Halacha as the &ldquo;crown of the Torah,&rdquo; following it with every step. All his actions instinctively followed the precepts which would be later set by our Sages. Because the supernal will was so dear to him, his nefesh, ruach, and neshamah (and consequently all his actions) became completely invested in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For he will never falter; the righteous man will be an eternal remembrance.&rdquo; (Tehillim 112:6)</p>
<p>As Chassidim we have the option of going &ldquo;L&rsquo;chatchila Ariber.&rdquo; Instead of fighting with the base instincts of this world we can meditate on the greatness of Hashem and thereby bind our very nature to the supernal will. Like Abraham we will then &ldquo;never falter,&rdquo; even in things that we do not yet fully comprehend intellectually.</p>
