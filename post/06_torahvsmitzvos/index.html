A Divine intent desires the fulfillment of those mitzvos which involve physicality. By fulfilling physical mitzvos we not only bind ourselves to this sublime Divine will, we also root our good intentions in physical reality, like &ldquo;a tree with many roots and few branches, whom all the storms in the world cannot budge from its place.&rdquo; (Pirkei Avot 3:17)</p><p>&ldquo;For they are a nation devoid of counsel, and they have no understanding.&rdquo; (Devarim 32:28)</p><p>By studying and practicing in this way, the Torah in turn becomes internal to us, infusing our mitzvos with vitality and soul.
