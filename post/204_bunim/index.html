But a chassid must go beyond the letter of the law, and take care not to delude himself, either.&rdquo;</p><p>Rabbi Bunim of Pshischa was a Hasidic Rebbe in Poland during the Napoleonic era. He sought to combine the light of Hasidic philosophy with the rationalistic pietism of German-Jewry. As such, one of his greatest principles was self-honesty and authenticity, which became foundational to Kotzk, Ger, and Vurka Hasidism, as well as many others.</p><p>He held that for one to fulfill a mitzvah properly, one must first work on himself. He believed that only those who have a clear understanding of themselves and where they are holding can begin to pursue personal authenticity in avodas Hashem. He taught that all actions have to be done with sincerity in a state of personal truthfulness, and that performing a mitzvah for the sake of personal interest or for the sake of conformity results in the mitzvah carrying less weight. He believed emotional and physical preparation for prayer to be crucial for one to be able to fulfill the mitzvos authentically, so much so that they should supercede halakhic restrictions of time. Above all, he believed that personal analysis and self-honesty are integral for the spiritual development of a Jew.</p><p>&ldquo;His Thoughts and His Mind, which knows all created beings, encompasses each and every created thing, from its head to its end, and its inside and very core, all in actual reality&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, middle of Chapter 48)</p><p>Why are self-honesty and authenticity so important? Because one must know before whom one is standing. One is standing before the King of the world, in whose figurative &ldquo;mind&rdquo; all creation exists. He beholds all created beings, encompassing each and every one of them, from their head to their end, from their inside and very core, all in actual reality, without any unclarity or misconceptions.</p><p>&ldquo;He beat His enemies into retreat, and dealt them eternal disgrace.&rdquo; (Tehillim 78:66)</p><p>G‑d is truth, he is eternal and unchanging. Therefore one must know that all fakeness and self-delusions are of a fleeting nature, for the world was created in truth and those who act contrary to it will not endure, as this verse in Tehillim says about the generation that &ldquo;regressed and rebelled&rdquo; (Tehillim 78:57), who &ldquo;angered Him with their high altars&rdquo; and caused G‑d to &ldquo;abandon the Tabernacle of Shilo&rdquo; (Tehillim 78:60). G‑d dealt them eternal disgrace and chose Judah in their stead, and built the &ldquo;built His Sanctuary permanent as the heavens&rdquo; (Tehillim 78:69) through David His servant, who loved G‑d and never resisted returning to the right way.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/205_earthfullness/><span>←</span><span>The Earth and Its Fullness</span></a>
