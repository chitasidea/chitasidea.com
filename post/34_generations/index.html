Never allowing the attachment to this world to grow too strong, by remembering that it is on the lowest rung of divine creation and that its reality is far surpassed by those of the higher worlds, is what enables a Jew to surpass all kinds of challenges. Because he knows that the logic of the higher worlds far surpasses that of this world, he can act irrationally for Hashem in this world, surviving insurmountable challenges with minimal apparent reward, and know that it all makes sense up above.</p><p>&ldquo;I will establish Your descendants forever; I will build your throne for all generations&rdquo; (Tehillim 89:5)</p><p>Sometimes we forget that the small impact we have in our life is multiplied throughout the generations. Sometimes we only manage to affect one person in our life, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean all our effort was worthless. From this one person can come generations and generations of righteous Jews, hundreds if not thousands of Torah scholars and Chassidim. We must never let our subjective feeling of accomplishment get in the way of our divine mission to do all we can, even if the result is not immediately apparent.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/35_womeninourlife/><span>←</span><span>Women in our Life</span></a>
