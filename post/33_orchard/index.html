We must leave the modern Land of Egypt, the obsession with physical experience, to bring down G-dliness everywhere we go, and we must always keep in mind that most of the fruits of our activities will remain hidden, too lofty to shine forth in this world. Similar to personal attainments, the fruits of our labors will only be revealed from their state of concealment when the world enters the next stage, the Times of Moshiach, may they come speedily in our days.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/34_generations/><span>←</span><span>Generations</span></a>
