A person does not forget for example where large sums of money are hidden, when he plans to go on vacation, or what agreements were made in an important business meeting. Only when we treat the Torah with a subtle attitude of casualness, seeing its externality as providing our animating force and source of delight, can we forget things written within it. In truth, the Torah is Hashem&rsquo;s delight, not ours, it being entirely one with Him. Because this pnimiyut of Torah is &ldquo;concealed from all mortal eyes,&rdquo; it is our job to constantly meditate on its significance and carry it into our lives.</p><p>&ldquo;And Timna was a concubine &mldr; the sister of Lotan was Timna&rdquo; (Bereishis 36:12/22)</p><p>What is the Torah&rsquo;s purpose in writing, &ldquo;Lotan’s sister was Timna?&rdquo; It is to show how much people longed to attach themselves to Abraham that Timnah, the daughter of chieftains, chose rather to be the concubine to one of his descendants than the mistress over a nation.</p><p>&ldquo;Like a warrior shouting [to sober himself] from wine.&rdquo; (Tehillim 78:65)</p><p>We too should humble ourselves in our quest to attach ourselves to Hashem and the ways of our forefathers. We must rouse ourselves from our natural indifference to holiness, shouting with great strength, to internalize the significance of Hashem&rsquo;s Torah. If we persist in this, we will never forget His teachings because they will be as important, in fact even more important, to us than our own physical needs.</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/58_gathering/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Gathering</span></a>
