G‑d, however, dwells in their midst but is unlimited and sublime in holiness. He stands in no comparison whatsoever to anything that is below, just like the number one, one million, one billion or even one trillion stands in no comparison and has no relevance or relationship to infinity.</p><p>&ldquo;For a seven day period you shall live in booths&rdquo; (Vayikra 23:42)</p><p>The festival of sukos, especially the sukah itself, represents the Divine energy which is transcendent and all-encompassing. Just like the sukah surrounds us on all sides, so too does Hashem transcend our created being, encompassing us on all sides to an infinite and incomprehensible extent. This is the awareness that G‑d exists apart from the world and beyond its limitations.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/203_shemittahbeforeafter/><span>←</span><span>Shemittah Before, Shemittah After</span></a>
