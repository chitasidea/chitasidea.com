It is impossible to do the mitzvah half way. You either fulfill its precepts with the proper intention or you negate the entire foundational principle of the mitzvah, rendering both the mitzvah and the motivation behind it invalid.</p><p>&ldquo;As our Sages state: &lsquo;For the work of heaven only that which is pure and permissible to eat may be used.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, beginning of Chapter 37)</p><p>The Alter Rebbe goes on to explain that the parchment of tefillin must come from a kosher animal, an esrog may not come from orlah, and tzedakah may not come from money obtained illegitimately. Thus we see again that there is no middle ground in mitzvos. You cannot act against Hashem and redeem yourself through the proceeds of such activity. You either do it properly, according to its precepts and specific intention, if prescribed, or you completely nullify it before Hashem.</p><p>&ldquo;They saw Your ways, O G‑d, the ways of my G‑d, my King, in holiness.&rdquo; (Tehillim 68:25)</p><p>All the ways of Hashem are in holiness. So too, everything we do serves to either further the side of holiness or that of the sitra achara. There is no middle ground. If we look at unclean things, entertain bad thoughts or speak destructive words, we are strengthening the side of unholiness, however small these acts may seem. On the other hand, when we are careful that our eyes only see that which is clean and holy, when we when we speak words of Torah, or think about them, we draw forth a major illumination of the Ein Sof-light in this physical world. We must constantly reflect on the fact that our actions have major spiritual consequences, and adjust our behavior accordingly.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/155_heavenearth/><span>←</span><span>Heaven and Earth ... the Seas and All That Moves Within Them</span></a>
