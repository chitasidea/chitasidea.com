We must never treat Hashem&rsquo;s commandments as happenstance, as a temporary concern, something to get over with and continue our lives from as quickly as possible, G‑d forbid. Sadly, if left uncorrected this is the natural mode a person will enter into if he does not constantly remind himself of the greatness of the Creator, especially during the daily prayers and during Shema and its blessings in particular.</p><p>&ldquo;Praise the L‑rd! I will give thanks to the L‑rd with all my heart, in the counsel of the upright and the congregation.&rdquo; (Tehillim 111:1)</p><p>We should use out the time of our daily prayer to the fullest, pouring our heart into a truthful connection with Hashem. Then we will be able to nullify the harsh decrees of our exile through our Divine service and return to Jerusalem ir hakodesh, speedily, soon in our days.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/211_wealthybusinessmancoachman/><span>←</span><span>The Wealthy Businessman and His Coachman</span></a>
