In light of the teaching of the Baal Shem Tov that every matter a Jew hears or sees is a lesson in his service of G‑d, the above events must bring a Jew to added strength in his spiritual service. Nevertheless we see that certain individuals act in the opposite way and used the above events to act contrary to G‑d&rsquo;s will. This is a great ingratitude on their part to a most magnumus level. <em>It is similar to a king that showed his love to a simple, low class and ill-mannered person, and the king descended from his palace with all his ministers and brought this man into his inner chambers.</em> Now, just imagine if this man would tell the king that in truth it is his palace and not the king&rsquo;s and therefore he will not respect the king&rsquo;s will and do as he sees fit. His first actions are to expel the king from his palace in all ways possible, through acting in a way contrary to the king&rsquo;s will on every matter. The meaning behind this parable and its relation to the occurrences in Israel are understood.&rdquo; (Igros Kodesh 11/85)</p><p>&ldquo;And you shall observe all My statutes and all My ordinances, and fulfill them, then the Land, to which I am bringing you to dwell therein, will not vomit you out.&rdquo; (Vayikra 20:22)</p><p>Without the Torah the Jewish people are nothing, with or without the State of Israel. In fact, one of the greatest possible contributions a Jew can make to safety and blessing in the Land of Israel is to keep the Torah and mitzvos. This will ensure the continued presence of Jews throughout the complete and undivided Land of Israel until the coming of Moshiach, may it be very soon, with the most complete attachment to G‑d possible anywhere in the world during this time of gollus. Undeniably the Land of Israel possesses a special holiness which affects all its inhabitants. This special providence must be used out in full to hasten and sweeten the arrival of Moshiach our deliverer, bekorov mamash, through Torah and mitzvos in an ever increasing manner of goodness.</p><p>&ldquo;But I trusted in You, O L‑rd; I said, &lsquo;You are my G‑d.&rsquo; My times are in Your hand; save me from the hands of my enemies and pursuers. Shine Your countenance upon Your servant; deliver me in Your kindness.&rdquo; (Tehillim 31:15-17)</p><p>When we affirm and reaffirm that we put our trust in G‑d alone, when we know that our fate is completely in His hands, He will save us from the hands of our enemies, as He has done time and time again since we became a people at Mt. Sinai. Hashem will shine His light onto us, and He will deliver us from this exile in complete and unfettered kindness, may it not be delayed for another second.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/197_unattendedlifelessbodies/><span>←</span><span>Unattended, Lifeless Bodies</span></a>
