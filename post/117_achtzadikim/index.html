Hashem&rsquo;s blessing does not rest upon an empty person. Only when one is engaged in Torah and mitzvos can the Holy One bestow additional life-force upon one&rsquo;s soul, which he can then draw from throughout his entire day. This is why it is so important to start your day with prayer, charity, and learning Torah, especially in conjunction with the daily Chitas portions.</p><p>&ldquo;Indeed, the righteous will extol Your Name; the upright will dwell in Your presence.&rdquo; (Tehillim 140:14)</p><p>When you extol Hashem in the beginning of the day on the exalted level of a &ldquo;tzadik&rdquo;–through the above mentioned prayer, charity and learning–you will merit to dwell in his presence on the earthly level of &ldquo;upright&rdquo; throughout the entire day.</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/118_uvcholmeodecha/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>U'vchol Me'odecha</span></a>
