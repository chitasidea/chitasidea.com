<p>[After preparing a gift to send to Joseph, Jacob prayed,] &ldquo;May G‑d Almighty grant that the man be merciful to you.&rdquo; (Bereishis 43:14)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conventional wisdom has it that prayer is necessary only in desperate situations. Thus, Jacob’s sons assumed that since Joseph was detaining their brother because he suspected them of being thieves or spies, it would be enough to pacify him with a gift. From Jacob’s words to his children, however, we learn that even when a favorable outcome seems perfectly natural, we should never assume that we can reach it without Divine assistance.&rdquo; (Lubavitcher Rebbe)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon contemplating and immersing oneself in any of the abovementioned aspects of G-d’s greatness, the middah of awe for the Divine Majesty will be born and aroused in one’s mind and thought, to fear and be humble before His blessed greatness, which is without end or limit, and there will also be born a dread of G-d in his heart.&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, end of Chapter 3)</p>
<p>When we constantly meditate on Hashem&rsquo;s greatness, how every being in the world is filled and encompassed by His life-force, we will indeed perceive that the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; occurrences of our lives are all in fact miracles garbed in nature. We will come to know, intellectually and emotionally, what it means to really love G-d - with &ldquo;fiery flames, with a passion, desire, and longing, and a yearning soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For I know that the Lord is great, our Master is greater than all supernal beings.&rdquo; (Tehillim 135:5)</p>
<p>To &ldquo;know&rdquo; Hashem (in the abovementioned way) is a prerequisite to feeling His greatness and seeing it in our lives.</p>
