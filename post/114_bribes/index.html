Weeping bitter tears, she begged him to summon to the court a man she accused of having wronged her.</p><p>Rabbi Yehoshua summoned the man to appear before the court, but referred the case to another rabbi, refusing to preside over it himself. &lsquo;The Torah forbids the taking of bribes,&rsquo; he explained. &lsquo;Do you think that a bribe is only a gift of money? Tears can also be a bribe that &lsquo;blinds the clear-sighted&rsquo;—especially the tears of a poor widow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>No matter what form the bribe takes, no matter how righteous the individual, it still blinds his eyes to the truth and causes him to forget Hashem&rsquo;s just precepts.</p><p>&ldquo;For at any time and moment, a person is capable and free to rid himself of the spirit of folly and the forgetfulness&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, beginning of Chapter 25)</p><p>The Alter Rebbe explains that a Jew can only come to sin if a spirit of folly and forgetfulness overcomes him. This spirit comes by way of the yetzer hara, who &ldquo;bribes&rdquo; the individual with pleasant words, enticing him to sin by reassuring him that this sin will not separate him from Hashem. In truth, every sin, no matter how small, causes a momentary separation from Hashem, which constitutes a plunge from the highest highs to lowest lows, as explained in yesterday&rsquo;s Tanya.</p><p>&ldquo;Never will I forget Your precepts, for through them You have sustained me.&rdquo; (Tehillim 119:93)</p><p>The more a person meditates on the fact that in every moment and in every place, Hashem sustains him with life-force, and any deviance from Hashem&rsquo;s will immediately causes this life force to be derived from the kelipot and sitra achara instead, which are called &ldquo;vomit and filth,&rdquo; the easier it will be for him to remember Hashem&rsquo;s precepts at all times, causing additional vitality to be drawn, exclusively from the side of light and holiness.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/115_oath/><span>←</span><span>Our Oath</span></a>
