<p>&ldquo;Abram took with him his wife, Sarai &mldr; and the souls which they had made in Charan&rdquo; (Bereishit 12:5) - Rambam: &ldquo;No sooner was this mighty one weaned — and he was but a child — than his mind began to seek and wonder: How do the heavenly bodies circle without a moving force? Who turns them? They cannot move themselves! Immersed amongst the foolish idol-worshippers of Ur Casdim, he had no one to teach him anything: his father, mother and countrymen, and he amongst them, all worshipped idols. But his heart sought &mldr; until he comprehended the truth and understood the righteous path by his sound wisdom, and came to know that there is one G-d . . . who created all, and that in all existence there is none other than Him. He came to know that the entire world erred &mldr;&rdquo; (Mishneh Torah, Laws Concerning Idol Worship 1:3)</p>
<p>There are different accounts at which age Abraham recognized that there was one Creator of the world. The Rambam puts this at 40, others at 4, 48, and 50. The Lubavitcher Rebbe explains that these sources are not in conflict, but rather relate to the various levels of recognition and understanding achieved by Abraham. Every step of the way gave Abraham a special insight into the might and glory of Hashem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For, as stated in the Gemara, [R. Shimon] countered every problematic query posed by R. Pinchas ben Yair with twenty-four solutions, and [R. Shimon] said to him: &ldquo;If you had not seen me like this,&rdquo; in this sorry state in the cave, [&ldquo;you would not have found me like this&rdquo;].&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Iggeret HaKodesh, beginning of Epistle 26)</p>
<p>The &ldquo;fact that [Rashbi] underwent anguish [when forced to hide] in the cave made him worthy of these attainments.&rdquo; Had he not gone through the trials and tribulations of his life, he would not have been granted the opportunity to attain such a deep understanding of the hidden parts of the Torah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He guides the humble with justice, and teaches the humble His way. All the paths of the Lord are kindness and truth for those who observe His covenant and testimonies.&rdquo; (Tehillim 25:9-10)</p>
<p>So too it is in our lives. Every experience in our life is an opportunity to understand Hashem in a deeper and more meaningful way. It is up to us to be &ldquo;humble&rdquo; and see this so we can be guided onto &ldquo;His way.&rdquo;</p>
