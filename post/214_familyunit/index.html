Nevertheless, G‑d had the families counted, in order to stress the centrality of the family in Judaism.</p><p>Our individual and national goals are certainly important, but the Torah also demands of us the selflessness necessary to forge the family unit. A husband and wife are two separate people, with their own natures, desires, and even missions in life; yet each must work for and work with the other, completing and complementing each other and merging into one harmonious, loving unit.</p><p>The strife and breakdown of communication from which the world suffers stem from selfishness. In contrast, the Torah commands us to love our neighbors as ourselves. The primary setting in which this commandment is fulfilled is that of our families. Inasmuch as loving our fellow Jew is an expression of our love of G‑d, loving our fellow Jew enhances our love of G‑d. Love of G‑d, in turn, brings us to love His Torah and study it – not merely out of our obligation to do so, but out of love. This threefold love of our fellow Jew, of G‑d, and of the Torah ripples outward from the family setting and affects the entire world for the better.&rdquo; (Daily Wisdom, Lubavitcher Rebbe)</p><p>&ldquo;The sun to rule by day, for His kindness is forever. The moon and stars to rule by night, for His kindness is forever.&rdquo; (Tehillim 136:8-9)</p><p>G‑d created both the sun and the moon as distinct units to fulfill different missions. However, both come together to fulfill a common purpose, illuminating the world at all times.</p><p>&ldquo;The manifestation of this general flow is the source of the vitality which the Worlds receive, each one in particular receiving but a diffused glow that shines forth from this source&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, beginning of Chapter 52)</p><p>The manifestation and revelation of G‑d&rsquo;s kindness that takes place in a selfless family unit of Torah and mitzvos radiates out as a diffused glow and affects the entire world.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/215_onemitzvah/><span>←</span><span>One Mitzvah</span></a>
