Said G‑d: &lsquo;I must compensate it.&rsquo; How did G‑d compensate the month of Kislev? With the dedication of the Temple by the Hasmoneans on Chanukah&rdquo; (Pesikta Rabbati).</p><p>G‑d compensated the darkness and emptiness of Kislev by giving it the light of Chanukah.</p><p>&ldquo;This being so, I will make Him a sanctuary and an abode by studying Torah at fixed times by day and by night, to the extent of my free time, as stipulated by the law governing each individual&rsquo;s situation, set forth in the Laws of Torah Study. As our Sages say, &lsquo;Even one chapter in the morning and one at night&rsquo; suffice, for one who can manage no more, for him to be regarded as &rsquo;engaging in Torah study day and night.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>So too, we must compensate the darkness of the night by tying it to the light of the morning through Torah study. Even one chapter is enough to accomplish this for one who can do no more. He should not feel worried about not having enough time to learn &ldquo;day and night,&rdquo; instead he should take upon himself a material commitment to learn a set amount each morning and evening, and follow through on it. This will be accounted for him miraculously as if he were &rsquo;engaging in Torah study day and night.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rather, his desire is in the Torah of the L‑rd, and in His Torah he meditates day and night.&rdquo; (Tehillim 1:2)</p><p>Explicit proof for the importance of daily Torah study, by day and by night, can be found in today&rsquo;s Tehillim. וְדַי לַמֵבִין - This will suffice for the understanding.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/146_oppositescoexist/><span>←</span><span>Opposites that Coexist</span></a>
