Even one chapter is enough to accomplish this for one who can do no more. He should not feel worried about not having enough time to learn &ldquo;day and night,&rdquo; instead he should take upon himself a material commitment to learn a set amount each morning and evening, and follow through on it. This will be accounted for him miraculously as if he were &rsquo;engaging in Torah study day and night.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rather, his desire is in the Torah of the L‑rd, and in His Torah he meditates day and night.&rdquo; (Tehillim 1:2)</p><p>Explicit proof for the importance of daily Torah study, by day and by night, can be found in today&rsquo;s Tehillim. וְדַי לַמֵבִין - This will suffice for the understanding.</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/146_oppositescoexist/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Opposites that Coexist</span></a>
