Although the illumination provided by their candles might be physically visible for only a limited time, their spiritual illumination continues throughout the entire week. (Lubavitcher Rebbe)</p><p>&ldquo;In the Upper Garden of Eden, the garments derive from the love and devotion of the heart with respect to Torah and prayer&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Iggeret HaKodesh, middle of Epistle 29)</p><p>Just as the light emanating from the Shabbos candles far outlasts that which is physically visible, &ldquo;when a mitzvah is performed, the radiance of the supernal will is more manifest in its more spiritual aspect — in its devout and loving intent — than in its tangible and physical aspect.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He delivered them for the sake of His Name, to make His strength known.&rdquo; (Tehillim 106:8)</p><p>Just as &ldquo;the superiority of devotion (kavanah) over speech and action is not due to its own merits but because of the radiance from the supernal will&rdquo; (Tanya, as above) so too is our bond with Hashem unconditional, not due to our own merits. We are bound to Hashem and the glory of His name. He gives to us not based on our righteousness but to make His own name known in the world. We can &ldquo;support&rdquo; Him in this task by lighting up the world, one Jewish home, one Shabbos candle, at a time.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/39_halacha/><span>←</span><span>Halacha</span></a>
