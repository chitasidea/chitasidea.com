Although the illumination provided by their candles might be physically visible for only a limited time, their spiritual illumination continues throughout the entire week.

We are bound to Hashem and the glory of His name. He gives to us not based on our righteousness but to make His own name known in the world. We can &ldquo;support&rdquo; Him in this task by lighting up the world, one Jewish home, one Shabbos candle, at a time.</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/39_halacha/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Halacha</span></a>
