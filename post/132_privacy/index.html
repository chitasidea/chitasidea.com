When he came to visit the Vurka Rebbe, the Vurka Rebbe wanted to test him if he was for real. He invited the chossid a half hour before Shabbos to eat. With only half an hour left to his week-long fast, it would have been most reasonable for the chossid to tell of his great feat. Instead, the chossid silently agreed to partake in the meal. He would rather break his arduous undertaking inches from the finish line than attain any glory from it.
