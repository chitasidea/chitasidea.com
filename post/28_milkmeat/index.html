Now, there are passages and commandments to which he could not possibly have related on a physical level.&rdquo; Instead, the mode of Abraham’s performance of the commandments was spiritual and esoteric, relating to the Torah from its innermost core. &ldquo;In the Time to Come, all Jews will know the Torah in a similar manner.&rdquo; (Tanya, as above)</p><p>&ldquo;The stream of G-d is full of water&rdquo; (Tehillim 65:10)</p><p>We will only fully perceive the depth and breadth of Hashem&rsquo;s stream of water, His Torah, in the time to come.
