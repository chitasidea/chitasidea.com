(Vayikra 6:15)</p><p>&ldquo;Our inner &lsquo;high priest&rsquo; is the innermost aspect and core of our soul, which is permanently bound to G‑d. This aspect of our soul is that part of us that refuses to participate in any act that is a denial of our connection with G‑d.</p><p>The classic example of something that disconnects us from G‑d is idolatry. But really, any violation of G‑d&rsquo;s will can be considered a form of idolatry, for when we violate G‑d&rsquo;s will we are serving something other than G‑d (whether it be money, fame, pleasure, or despair).&rdquo; (Daily Wisdom, Lubavitcher Rebbe)</p><p>&ldquo;To G‑d alone does my soul hope; my salvation is from Him.&rdquo; (Tehillim 62:2)</p><p>The key to progressing in our Avodat Hashem is realizing that G‑d is the only actually existent entity, as it says in Bereishis Rabbah 68 &ldquo;G‑d is the Place of the world, the world is not the place of G‑d.&rdquo; There is no such thing as being half-religious, there is no such thing as keeping some mitzvos but not others. If you are going step-by-step and haven&rsquo;t arrived at observance of a certain mitzvah, that is one thing. But settling on incomplete observance of Hashem&rsquo;s holy Torah or even making an ideology out of it is completely wrong. It is our natural inclination to simplify things and accept certain imperfections in our lives, however, this instinct must be completely eradicated in our religious observance. Our soul must hope to G‑d alone.</p><p>We must always strive for more. We must consciously acknowledge that G‑d is the only existent entity, and that &ldquo;any violation of G‑d&rsquo;s will can be considered a form of idolatry&rdquo; in that it temporarily refutes and disconnect us from the origin of all being, the Holy One, blessed be He. &ldquo;If we would only realize this fact, nothing could entice us away from fulfilling G‑d&rsquo;s will – whether by dwelling on unholy or depressing thoughts, by speaking unholy or insensitive words, or by performing unholy or destructive actions.&rdquo; (Daily Wisdom, as above)</p><p>&ldquo;Then, the dross of the body and of the world will be refined, and they will be able to receive the revelation of G‑d&rsquo;s light that will shine forth over Israel by means of the Torah, which is called &lsquo;might.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, end of Chapter 36)</p><p>&ldquo;Our personal &lsquo;high-priestly&rsquo; grain-offering is the meditative contemplation through which we channel the innermost core of our souls. Like the high priest&rsquo;s offering, drawing upon the power of this core is necessary both in the figurative &lsquo;morning,&rsquo; i.e., when we feel enlightened and inspired, in order to ensure that we channel our energy in accordance with G‑d&rsquo;s will, and in the figurative &rsquo;evening,&rsquo; i.e., when we feel confused or uninspired, in order to ensure that we resist the temptation to go against what we know we should be doing.&rdquo; (Daily Wisdom, as above)</p><p>By channeling the innermost core of our souls, at all times, &lsquo;morning&rsquo; and &rsquo;evening,&rsquo; we will gradually refine the dross of our body and prepare ourselves for receiving the ultimate revelation of G‑d&rsquo;s light that will shine forth in the World to Come.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/154_nomiddleground/><span>←</span><span>No Middle Ground</span></a>
