We know what to do and at what time. However, the underlying holiness of what we are doing, the underlying reason, remains hidden.</p><p>&ldquo;O that out of Zion would come Israel&rsquo;s deliverance! When G-d returns the captivity of His people, Jacob will exult, Israel will rejoice.&rdquo; (Tehillim 53:7)</p><p>This is why it is sometimes hard for us to overcome our evil inclination against performing a mitzvah. If we would know the true spiritual effect of our cleaving to G-d by fulfilling his will we would not hesitate to perform any mitzvah. The clear and open revelation of the spiritual fabric of the world is the true magnitude of the coming redemption.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/28_milkmeat/><span>←</span><span>Milk and Meat</span></a>
