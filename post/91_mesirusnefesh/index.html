(See Daniel, ch. 3.) They argued to themselves: If frogs, which are not commanded concerning the sanctification of the divine name, yet it is written of them, &lsquo;They shall come up and go into your ovens,&rsquo; we, who are commanded concerning the sanctification of the Name, how much the more so!&rdquo;</p><p>The Rebbe expounds on this, &ldquo;&lsquo;Self-sacrifice&rsquo; is not just the willingness to die for one&rsquo;s beliefs; it is the way in which one lives for them. It is the willingness to sacrifice one&rsquo;s &lsquo;self&rsquo; — one&rsquo;s desires, one&rsquo;s preconceptions, one&rsquo;s most basic inclinations. Indeed, the Hebrew term for self-sacrifice, mesirus nefesh, means both &lsquo;giving of life&rsquo; and &lsquo;giving of will.&rsquo;</p><p>Thus the lesson of self-sacrifice is derived from a frog, a cold-blooded creature, who enters a burning oven. The ultimate test of faith goes beyond the issue of life and death — it is the ability to transcend one&rsquo;s very nature for the sake of a higher truth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, in relation to the rank of the beinoni, [this level of love] is regarded as a truly perfect service in terms of their level of truth, i.e., the level of beinonim, in each man relative to his standing in the category of the beinonim&rdquo; (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, end of Chapter 13)</p><p>Tanya explains that truth is not an absolute matter. What for the beinoni is a truly perfect service wouldn&rsquo;t be considered a &ldquo;true service&rdquo; at all for the tzadik.</p><p>&ldquo;I will run on the path of Your commandments, for You will broaden my heart.&rdquo; (Tehillim 119:32)</p><p>Similarly, Hashem doesn&rsquo;t call us up to sacrifice our life every day under the banner of &ldquo;mesirus nefesh.&rdquo; Rather, He wants us to overcome our own nature every day as explained by the Rebbe above. Through &ldquo;running on His path,&rdquo; Hashem &ldquo;broadens our heart&rdquo; and we progress, and there might even come a day on which we are called upon to do actual &ldquo;mesirus nefesh&rdquo; in the truest sense of the word. Still, at our current level, overcoming our nature is considered a truly perfect service, akin to the ultimate &ldquo;mesirus nefesh&rdquo; performed by the previous generations.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://chitasidea.com/post/92_spiritualhygiene/><span>←</span><span>Spiritual Hygiene</span></a>
