In any case, only a man who has been prepared appropriately can be sent off to carry out this important task.</p><p>This teaches us that, just as the &ldquo;timely man,&rdquo; we must go out into our day prepared, by praying honestly and learning on a fixed daily schedule. With this we will be well equipped to carry out the important tasks of our life, elevating our surroundings and making our corner of the world into a dwelling place for G‑d.</p><p>&ldquo;Fortunate is the man whose strength is in You; the paths to the Temple are in his heart.&rdquo; (Tehillim 84:6)</p><p>By beginning our day as described above, we will inscribe the paths to the Temple in our heart. Our strength will be in Hashem. We will have the necessary focus and courage to spread meaningful positivity in our environment, inspiring our fellow Jews to follow in the ways of the Torah and bringing the light of truth into our world of spiritual darkness.</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center rounded-l-md p-6 pr-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://chitasidea.com/post/182_abovebeyond/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Above and Beyond</span></a>
