"Chitas Idea" is a daily write-up weaving together all three Chitas portions in one common thread.

Chitas is a daily study regimen instituted by Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn of Lubavitch, the current Lubavitcher Rebbe's predecessor, which includes a portion of Chumash (Torah), Tehillim (Psalms) and Tanya (the fundamental book of Chassidut). This project aims to use the incredible power of the internet to spread its teachings throughout the world, in a short, easy to understand format.

Additionally, this website features study notes on a range of topics, in a succinct format.

Dedicated to my wife who encouraged me to start this.
