"There is yet another direct path open to man, namely, to occupy himself with Torah and mitzvot lishmah through the attribute of our forefather Jacob, peace unto him, this being the attribute of mercy." (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, Chapter 45)

The path to Torah through the attribute of Jacob is to engender a feeling of mercy for the Divine spark which animates one's soul that has descended from its lofty source into exile within the body, which is called a "serpent's skin." By doing so, a person will naturally feel great mercy towards it, "especially when he recalls all his actions and utterances and thoughts since the day he came into being, unworthy as they were." He will then seek to do everything and anything that is necessary to alleviate its pain and restore it to its prior place, through the "actual kisses" of studying Torah and the "actual embrace" of active observance of the commandments. (See Tanya for an explanation of the terms "actual kisses" and "actual embrace")

"May the L‑rd answer you on the day of distress; may the Name of the G‑d of Jacob fortify you." (Tehillim 20:2)

Why do we see "the G‑d of Jacob" so often, not "the G‑d of Abraham?" One possible explanation is that it is written in Isaiah 29:22, "Of Jacob, who redeemed Abraham." Tanya explains this to be the summary of the above idea of the "path to Torah through the attribute of Jacob," to quote:

"In the context of man's spiritual service, Abraham denotes man's love of G‑d, while Jacob symbolizes the attribute of compassion. When 'Abraham'—the individual's love for G‑d—is hidden and must be 'redeemed' and revealed, it is 'Jacob'—the attribute of compassion—that brings about this redemption. The arousal of profound compassion for one's soul enables his latent love of G‑d to become manifest."

"When a stranger sojourns with you in your land, you shall not taunt him. The stranger who sojourns with you shall be as a native from among you, and you shall love him as yourself; for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. I am the L‑rd, your G‑d." (Vayikra 19:33-34)

In the above context these verses could be interpreted to mean: Do not taunt your Divine spark by committing brazen sins, for you too were in exile among a more lowly environment in the land of Egypt. Have compassion on your Divine spark, by remembering the pains of your physical exile, and love it as you love your physical self, by caring for it and reattaching it to its true Source above.
