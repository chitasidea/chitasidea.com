##### 26 Nissan 5782

"I.e., it will not clothe itself in anything of pleasure or enjoyment, whether physical or spiritual, to love it and will not desire anything whatsoever in the world other than G‑d alone, the Source of the vitality of all enjoyments" (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, beginning of Chapter 43)

Ahavat Olam, the "lower level" of love for G‑d, already causes one's soul to divest itself from the pleasures of this world and see through them to their higher, spiritual origin, "the Source of the vitality of all enjoyments." In such moments of deep contemplation and connection to G‑d, the soul no longer desires the pleasures of this world, "for they are all nullified in reality and are accounted as nothing at all, compared with Him."

"The children of Israel should bring their offerings which they slaughter on the open field, and bring them to the L‑rd, to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, to the kohen, and slaughter them as peace offerings to the L‑rd." (Vayikra 17:5)

This commandment is directed towards all of Israel, not only the ones who have used their intellectual powers to connect with G‑d consciously. From this we learn that the love and fear of G‑d necessary to perform Torah and mitzvos are accessible to all. It is possible for all to not necessarily divest themselves from the pleasures of the world, but to reorient them towards holiness, like the offerings which must be brought at the Mishkan, not in the "open field." Specifically "peace offerings," mentioned later on in this context, are offerings from which even the person bringing them may benefit, representing the kind of pleasure which is not wholly divested from physicality but still aimed towards holiness.

"How sweet are Your words to my palate, [sweeter] than honey to my mouth!" (Tehillim 119:103)

Still, even when we have not reached the level yet where all our pleasures are the Glory of Hashem alone, or even when not all our physical pleasures are directed towards holiness, we must observe His words, and actively work on making them our foremost pursuit and pleasure.
