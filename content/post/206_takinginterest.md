"You shall not take from him interest or increase" (Vayikra 25:36)

What is so bad about interest? After all, it is just money. You are not hurting anybody physically.

The truth is that interest goes against the very foundational principles on which G‑d wants the world to operate:

"There is a subtle yet crucial difference between an investor profiting from his investment and a lender profiting from a loan. When we invest in a financial venture, the invested money still belongs to us; thus, our money is 'working' for us. We have therefore earned the profit that the venture returns. In contrast, a loan transfers ownership of the principal to the borrower; the money now belongs to the borrower, even though he is obligated to repay it later. Thus, taking interest on a loan is profiting from someone else’s effort without having participated in that effort. The lender is collecting interest based only upon the fact that the money used to belong to him.

Taking interest on a loan is therefore opposed to the way G‑d wants the world to operate. G‑d intended that we refine ourselves by working for our achievements, both spiritual and material. In the words of the sages, 'If someone says to you, 'I have toiled without results,' do not believe him. If he says, 'I have not toiled, but have nonetheless seen results,' do not believe him either. Only if he says, 'I have toiled and seen results,' believe him.'" (Daily Wisdom, Lubavitcher Rebbe)

"'The whole earth is full of His glory,' namely, the Community of Israel above i.e., malchut of Atzilut, the source of Jewish souls, which is called 'earth,' and Israel on this earth below, wherein Jews perform Torah and mitzvot, for which reason specifically is this world filled with His glory: it is here that G‑d clothes and reveals Himself" (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, middle of Chapter 49)

Not taking interest, of which Rashi says, "A person's desire is naturally attracted to taking interest, and it is difficult to stay away from it, for he rationalizes and grants himself false permission because of his money which was lying idle while in his the debtor's hands," is a great trial. But it is for this very reason that the Torah says two verses later, "I am the L‑rd, your G‑d, Who took you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, to be a G‑d to you," as Rashi explains there. G‑d's glory is only able to fill the world when Israel fulfills the Torah and mitzvot. As such, He can only be truly present, be a G‑d to us, when we leave our spiritual Egypt and refrain from those matters which are extremely tempting, yet nonetheless plain wrong.

"Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; kindness and truth go before Your countenance. Fortunate is the people who know the sound of the shofar; L‑rd, they walk in the light of Your countenance." (Tehillim 89:15-16)

Righteousness and justice are the foundation of G‑d's throne. His Torah reflects His perfect truth and justice. We must follow it in all matters, even everyday monetary transactions, to merit knowing the sound of His shofar, the final redemption, and to walk in the light of His countenance from there on out.
