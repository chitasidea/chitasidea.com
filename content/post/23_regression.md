"And it came to pass when Abram came to Egypt" (Bereishit 12:14)

Instead of being allowed to pursue his monotheistic revival in G‑d's Promised Land, Abraham was thrust into the world’s most prominent bastion of paganism. How ironic that the ambitious monotheist was suddenly reduced to seeking the mercy of a cultural environment that mocked his every ideal. Yet, in a miraculous reversal of fortune, Abraham shortly thereafter returned to the Land of Israel with greater wealth and with a greater reputation. It became retroactively clear that this apparent regression was actually a further stage in Abraham’s progression toward his goals.

"There is no need to dwell on something so obvious — as the fact that these laws will still apply in the time of Mashiach so that then, too, it will be necessary to know the laws of issur and hetter, and purity and impurity" (Lessons in Tanya, Iggeret HaKodesh, middle of Epistle 26)

So too it is with our current state of exile. All the practical laws of the Torah will still apply in the times of Mashiach. Our current state of exile gives us ample time to prepare ourselves for unblemished service after the redemption.

"For the word of the Lord is just; all His deeds are done in faithfulness." (Tehillim 33:4)

This verse in Tehillim seems to hint at this very idea. Hashem's deeds are done in faithfulness to bring us closer to his word, which is the ultimate standard of justice and beauty in this world.
