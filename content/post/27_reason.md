"And he split them in the middle" (Bereishit 15:10)

"Our sages explain the symbolism in the animals which G‑d told Abraham to take. On one level, they correspond with the various offerings brought by the Jewish people in the Holy Temple. On another level, they represent the galut of Israel in its various incarnations — the powers to which the Jewish people will be subject in the course of their history (Egypt, Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome, etc.) The eagle which came to consume the carcasses but was shooed away represents Moshiach, who will be prevented from liberating the people of Israel until the time for the Redemption has come." (Lubavitcher Rebbe)

"The reason [underlying a particular halachah] derives mystically from the sefirah of supernal chochmah, from which sparks fell into the kelipot as a result of the primordial "breaking of the vessels."" (Lessons in Tanya, Iggeret HaKodesh, middle of Epistle 26)

"This explains the magnitude of the exile (and of the redemption) — even though the law itself is known and not in exile." (Lubavitcher Rebbe) Before the arrival of Moshiach the law itself remains clear to our understanding. We know what to do and at what time. However, the underlying holiness of what we are doing, the underlying reason, remains hidden.

"O that out of Zion would come Israel's deliverance! When G-d returns the captivity of His people, Jacob will exult, Israel will rejoice." (Tehillim 53:7)

This is why it is sometimes hard for us to overcome our evil inclination against performing a mitzvah. If we would know the true spiritual effect of our cleaving to G-d by fulfilling his will we would not hesitate to perform any mitzvah. The clear and open revelation of the spiritual fabric of the world is the true magnitude of the coming redemption.
