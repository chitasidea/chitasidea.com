"It came to pass at the end of two years" (Bereishis 41:1)

"Every affliction to befall man has a set time to end, as it is written, 'An end He set to darkness, and every limit He investigates' (Job 28:3). This is said regarding Joseph, who had been ten years in prison [when he asked the chief butler to intercede for him], but Gâ€‘d investigated and saw that it was necessary for him to be imprisoned for another two years ... 'In every sorrow there is profit' (Proverbs 14:23). This too is said in regard to Joseph, who suffered in prison and then profited from it [in becoming] ruler over Egypt ...'" (Midrash Tanchuma)

"If a person considers himself wicked, he will be grieved at heart and depressed, and consequently will not be able to serve G-d joyfully and with a contented heart." (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, beginning of Chapter 1)

So too, one should only consider onself wicked, and feel sorrow over one's sins, to such a degree that one can still profit from it. This means knowing that one has temptation and working on it, but not, Chaz ve Shalom, becoming depressed and disgusted with onself. This can only lead to sadness and indifference, with sin eventually not perturbing one at all.

"He raises the poor from the dust, lifts the destitute from the dunghill, to seat them with nobles, with the nobles of His people." (Tehillim 113:7-8)

On our own, our work in refining our character and becoming closer to Hashem would never succeed. This could lead us to great sadness, however, Hashem in his great mercy takes us out from our sorrow, to seat us with the Holy Tzaddikim in Gan Eden and the World to Come, due to our earnest and wholehearted effort, despite our limitations.
