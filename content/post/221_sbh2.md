Ordinary Bread: Types of loaves upon which people ordinarly base a meal

Types of loaves upon which people do not ordinarly base a meal (Baked Goods)
- If one eats casually → Mezonos/Al Hamichyah
- If one eats amount sufficient to constitute basis of a meal (of regular person) →  Hamotzi/Bircas Hamazon

### 2:2 - Amount of Baked Goods sufficient to constitute basis of meal

Many opinions, Actual practice
- If individual is not satisfied, then if ate x amount of Baked Goods
  - x =<= 6 k'beitzos → Mezonos/Al Hamichyah
  - 6 K'beitzos =<= x < Half Isaron → Only in Meal
  - Half Isaron =<= x → Hamotzi/Bircas Hamazon
- If individual is satisfied, then if ate x amount of Baked Goods
  - x < 4 K'beitzos → Only in Meal
  - 4 K'beitzos =<= x → Hamotzi/Bircas Hamazon

K'beitzah: 50 ml  
Half Isaron: 0,625 l

## 2:3 - Amount of Baked Goods & Accompanying Foods
