##### 8 Adar I 5782

"Even if lustful imaginings or other extraneous thoughts occur to him during his service of G-d—in Torah or in prayer with kavanah—he should pay them no attention but avert his mind from them immediately." (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, Chapter 28)

In this perek of Tanya, the Alter Rebbe gives us very practical advice on how to daven properly. Of course, it is replete with deep insights of the secrets of Torah, as is any portion of Tanya, however, the core focus here is to teach us how to connect to Hashem on a daily basis. We do this simply by recognizing our place, knowing that we are not tzaddikim and we cannot sublimate disturbing thoughts at their source. Instead we ignore them completely, like a "wicked heathen" who comes only to pester and confuse. A person should constantly recall that "he will gain nothing by responding; if he answers one question, he will promptly be asked another."

"Our hearts have not retracted, nor have our steps strayed from Your path." (Tehillim 44:19)

By this method we will be able to remain focused throughout the entire prayer, without our hearts retracting or our steps straying. Note that even the Holy Baal Shem Tov said one should approach prayer gradually–focusing most of his energy on Pesukei DeZimrah, Shema, and Shmonei Esrei–however this was not said in regards to allowing extraneous thoughts but davening with hitlahavut (burning enthusiasm) which no normal person can sustain for extended periods of time (Tzava'at Harivash 32, 38, 42 in conjunction with 61).

"You shall make the entire ram go up in smoke upon the altar; it is a burnt offering made to the L-rd; it is a spirit of satisfaction, a fire offering for the L-rd." (Shemos 29:18)

In doing so, our prayer will be an actual service to Hashem, a "spirit of satisfaction," as Rashi explains, "It is satisfaction to Me that I commanded and My will was performed."
