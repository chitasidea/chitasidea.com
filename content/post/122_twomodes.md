##### 5 Adar I 5782

"Just as with material food, there are two kinds of delicacies—one of sweet and luscious foods and the other of sharp or sour articles which are unpleasant to eat in their natural state, but have been well spiced and prepared so that they become delicacies which revive the soul—so, too, are there two kinds of spiritual delicacies." (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, middle of Chapter 27)

The commentary explains, "One is provided by tzaddikim, who are occupied solely with matters that are 'good' and 'sweet'—holy matters ... The second kind of delicacy is provided by beinonim, who are occupied with 'bitter' matters, with battling against the sitra achara in their soul, and with the evil thoughts that it spawns."

"And you bring near to yourself your brother Aaron, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel to serve Me [as kohanim]: Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar, Aaron's sons." (Shemos 28:1)

The Rebbe picks up on the two modes of Divine service in his commentary on this verse: "It would seem that we should all want to be priests, consecrated to G‑d and totally steeped in Divine consciousness. This is indeed a worthy ideal, but if it were put into practice, it would undermine the purpose of Creation. G‑d created us not to be angels but human beings who live in the mundane world. Only this way can we can elevate the world, refine it, and fill it with Divine consciousness.

On the other hand, in order to elevate the world, we need to preserve an image of the totally Divine way of living that we are striving to elevate it to. Hence, a select minority of the people had to live out this ideal in practice; they were the priests. Similarly, we must all consecrate a portion of our personality to the sole purpose of serving G‑d. By creating ('installing') this 'inner priest,' we can then relate to the world at large as we are meant to, guiding and leading it to its Divine fulfillment. This is how we fulfill G‑d's promise to us when He gave us the Torah: 'You will be unto Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.'" (Daily Wisdom, Lubavitcher Rebbe)

"Guard your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking deceit. Turn away from evil and do good, seek peace and pursue it." (Tehillim 34:14-15)

We thus see that there are two modes of serving Hashem, both valid and necessary, but with unique challenges and significance to G‑d. Most people, who fall into the category of potential Beinonim, only have the task of subduing their Yetzer Hara to a point where its desires don't translate into conscious thought, speech or action. They shouldn't fret about not being a tzdaddik, but instead "guard [their] tongue from evil and [their] lips from speaking deceit" in speech, "turn away from evil" in thought, and "do good" in action.
