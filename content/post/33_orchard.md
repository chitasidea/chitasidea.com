"[The tzadik's ascent] effects a union, between the spiritually feminine sefirah of malchut and the spiritually masculine levels of Divine efflux that transcend it, by means of the elevation of mayin nukvin constituted by all of [the tzaddik’s] actions, his Torah, and the Divine service in which he engaged all the days of his life." (Lessons in Tanya, Iggeret HaKodesh, end of Epistle 27)

This is so because "all of man’s lifelong labors and attainments are revealed from their former state of concealment and shine forth at the time of his passing." (Tanya, as above)

"[Abraham] planted an orchard [and opened an inn] in Beersheba. There he proclaimed the name of G‑d." (Bereishis 21:33)

Similarly, many of the effects of our actions in spreading G-dliness in the world remain hidden to our eyes. "By establishing a public institution that challenged the world’s hallowed tenets, Abraham promoted awareness of monotheism even among people who never actually visited his inn ... Likewise today, the very existence of synagogues and institutions of Torah study exert great positive influence upon a city simply by the mere virtue of their presence, over and above the intrinsic value of the study and prayer that take place within their walls." (Lubavitcher Rebbe)

"You brought a vine out of Egypt; You drove out nations and planted it. You cleared space before it; it took root and filled the land." (Tehillim 80:9-10)

If we want to hasten the arrival of Moshiach, we must take root and "fill the land" with G-dliness. We must leave the modern Land of Egypt, the obsession with physical experience, to bring down G-dliness everywhere we go, and we must always keep in mind that most of the fruits of our activities will remain hidden, too lofty to shine forth in this world. Similar to personal attainments, the fruits of our labors will only be revealed from their state of concealment when the world enters the next stage, the Times of Moshiach, may they come speedily in our days.
