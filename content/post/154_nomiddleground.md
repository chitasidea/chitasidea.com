##### 12 Adar II 5782

"And if any of the flesh of his peace offering is to be eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted; it shall not count for the one who offers it; [rather,] it shall be rejected, and the person who eats of it shall bear his sin." (Vayikra 7:18)

Rashi explains, "Scripture is referring to someone who, at the time of slaughtering the sacrifice, intends to eat it on the third day in which case the sacrifice becomes invalid." The Torah teaches us here that there is no middle ground when offering sacrifices. It is impossible to do the mitzvah half way. You either fulfill its precepts with the proper intention or you negate the entire foundational principle of the mitzvah, rendering both the mitzvah and the motivation behind it invalid.

"As our Sages state: 'For the work of heaven only that which is pure and permissible to eat may be used.'" (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, beginning of Chapter 37)

The Alter Rebbe goes on to explain that the parchment of tefillin must come from a kosher animal, an esrog may not come from orlah, and tzedakah may not come from money obtained illegitimately. Thus we see again that there is no middle ground in mitzvos. You cannot act against Hashem and redeem yourself through the proceeds of such activity. You either do it properly, according to its precepts and specific intention, if prescribed, or you completely nullify it before Hashem.

"They saw Your ways, O G‑d, the ways of my G‑d, my King, in holiness." (Tehillim 68:25)

All the ways of Hashem are in holiness. So too, everything we do serves to either further the side of holiness or that of the sitra achara. There is no middle ground. If we look at unclean things, entertain bad thoughts or speak destructive words, we are strengthening the side of unholiness, however small these acts may seem. On the other hand, when we are careful that our eyes only see that which is clean and holy, when we when we speak words of Torah, or think about them, we draw forth a major illumination of the Ein Sof-light in this physical world. We must constantly reflect on the fact that our actions have major spiritual consequences, and adjust our behavior accordingly.
