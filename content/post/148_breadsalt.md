##### 5 Adar II 5782

[G‑d told Moshe,] "You must offer up salt on all your sacrifices." (Vayikra 2:13)

"All four kingdoms of creation are incorporated in the sacrifices: Salt is the mineral element; the oil, wine, and flour that accompany sacrifices are the vegetative element; the animal itself is the animal element; the person offering the sacrifice and the priest officiating at the sacrifice are the human element. Through these representatives, the sacrifice elevates all four kingdoms of creation into holiness." (Daily Wisdom, Lubavitcher Rebbe)

"King Solomon cried out, saying, 'Let there be no lack of oil above your head,' for the light over his head requires oil, meaning good deeds and for this reason, 'the wise man’s eyes are in his head'" (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, middle of Chapter 35)

The wise man is always focused on supplying enough fuel for the Shechinah, the light that rests upon his head. This means that he directs all his efforts and uses all resources at his disposal to glorify and brighten G‑d's presence in the world through his good deeds. Just like the sacrifices in the times of the Holy Temple, today "the animal and vegetable food that we eat is our own personal 'sacrifice,' since by eating it, we transform it into the fuel that enables us to fulfill G‑d's commandments, thereby elevating it into holiness." (Daily Wisdom, as above)

"He gathers the waters of the sea like a mound; He places the deep waters in vaults." (Tehillim 33:7)

Rashi explains, "When G‑d separated the supernal waters from the lower waters, He made a covenant with the lower waters that their salt will be offered on the altar." Nowadays, when we don't have an "official" altar, "our tables are our own personal 'altars.' Traditionally, the bread that we eat is first dipped in salt. In this way, we elevate all four kingdoms of creation at our table, just as they were in the sacrifices." (Daily Wisdom, as above)
