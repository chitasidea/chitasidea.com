##### 22 Kislev 5782

"It is well known how bitter is the punishment of he who 'withholds food,' i.e., who withholds Torah knowledge from he who seeks it." (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, middle of Compiler's Foreword)

It is not allowed to withhold Torah from one who needs it. In our generation all Jews are in need of spiritual sustenance, especially from the elucidated teachings of Chassidus as laid out in the Tanya. All who can teach Tanya, must find time to do so, at least to one person. They must not "lay their hand upon their mouth," with false modesty and humility, G-d forbid, for misplaced modesty is falsehood.

"And it came about on a certain day, that he came to the house to do his work, and none of the people of the house were there in the house." (Bereishis 39:11)

Rashi comments here, "[There is a controversy here between] Rav and Shmuel. One said: his actual work, and the other said: to perform his needs with her, but his fatherâ€™s image appeared [to him]." Sometimes we are overwhelmed with desire. Our own self-control cannot measure up to the test Hashem puts before us. In those moments we count on the Holy Tzaddikim, like Yaakov, to intercede on our behalf. Anyone who studies and teaches the Tanya, will merit to connect to the Neshama of the Alter Rebbe. As the Rebbe Rashab phrased it, "To study the Tanya is to converse with the Alter Rebbe."

"So shall say those redeemed by the Lord, those whom He redeemed from the hand of the oppressor." (Tehillim 107:2)

"This psalm speaks of those who are saved from four specific perilous situations (imprisonment, sickness, desert travel, and sea travel) and must thank G-d, for their sins caused their troubles, and only by the kindness of G-d were they saved. It is therefore appropriate that they praise G-d and tell of their salvation to all" (Tehilllim Ohel Yoseph Yitzchok). Those who were saved by Hashem from the abyss of raw materialism through His holy teachings have an obligation to share that light with others.
