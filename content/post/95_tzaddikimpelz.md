##### 1 Shevat 5782

"A man did not see his fellow, nor did anyone get up from his place for three days" (Shemos 10:23)

"There is no greater darkness than one in which 'a man did not see his fellow' — in which a person becomes oblivious to the needs of his fellow man. When that happens, a person becomes stymied in his personal development as well — 'nor did anyone get up from his place.'" (Chiddushei HaRim)

"He who is not inherently studious but has accustomed himself to study diligently so that this habit has become his second nature; for him, too, the hidden love of G-d is sufficient, unless he wishes to study more than he usually does." — "To do so, he must arouse a conscious love of G-d in his heart. Only such a love can supply the strength necessary to free himself from the restraints of his acquired nature." (Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim, middle of Chapter 15)

Personal development depends on constantly challenging yourself and your acquired nature. However, at the same time this must never become a self-centered race to become "tzaddik im pelz" (a tzaddik in a fur coat), meaning one who has attained an elevated level for himself but refuses to share this light with others. Such a person is oblivious to the needs of his fellow Jew, especially in this generation of palpable darkness, in which every glimmer of truth has an effect many times over.

"Answer me when I call, O G-d [Who knows] my righteousness. You have relieved me in my distress; be gracious to me and hear my prayer." (Tehillim 4:29)

Tzedakah (charity) has its root in the Hebrew word for righteousness, as used in the verse above. When Hashem sees the charity/righteousness, spiritual or material, we do for another Jew, He will also be gracious to us when we call. In the end, apart from the tremendous reward it brings in and of itself, for the individual and for the entire Jewish people, caring about one another will also serve to aid in our own personal development.
