##### 13 Kislev 5782

"Even one who crinkles his hair, and the like, receives his life-force at that moment from the spiritual chambers of the kelipot, as is explained in the Zohar." (Lessons in Tanya, Kuntres Acharon, Essay 5)

Even a man who spends time in front of the mirror, manicuring his hair and beard, transgresses the strict will of Hashem. Because of this his life-force in that moment is not drawn from holiness, but from the "hinderpart of the ten sefirot of holiness" that is the nurture of Kelipot.

"Now take my gift, which has been brought to you, for God has favored me [with it], and [because] I have everything." (Bereishis 33:11)

In this Parasha we see how careful Yaakov was to distance himself from coarse language and all forms of unholiness. Earlier Esau assured Yaakov that, "What you have remain yours." To explain his generosity he, unlike Yaakov, spoke haughtily, saying "I have plenty," [meaning] much more than I need. Yaakov made a similar statement of generosity, however, in it he humbled himself, saying "I have everything," all my necessities. Even the smallest deeds, miniscule changes in wording, can derive either from holiness or the Sitra Achra, it is our choice.

"O my God, rescue me from the hand of the wicked, from the palm of the scheming and violent." (Tehillim 71:4)

On the way to achieving such close adherence to the will of Hashem we need a lot of support. It is not in our power to free ourselves from the "hand of the wicked" inclination all by ourselves. Therefore we need to actively ask Hashem for assistance. In combination with our sincere efforts Hashem is certain to grant us success, as the Chapter in Tehillim ends, "Those who seek my harm are shamed and disgraced."
